The authors have identified a high-affinity inhibitory collagen receptor LAIR-1 and a soluble decoy receptor LAIR-2 (with even higher binding affinity to collagen), which can be therapeutically targeted to block tumor progression. Dr Meyaard and colleagues have also generated a dimeric LAIR-2 human IgG1 Fc fusion protein NC410 for therapeutic use. With humanized mouse models engrafted with functional human immune systems (PBMC), they have explored the anti-cancer efficacy of NC410 and revealed its impact on modulating immune responses. Furthermore, they extended this study to identify biomarkers of predictive value for NC410-based anti-cancer therapy."
