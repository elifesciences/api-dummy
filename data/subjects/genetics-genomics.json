We welcome studies in all areas of human genetics as well as those that use cellular and animal models to explore traits of broad relevance to health and disease. We are particularly keen to see studies that use human genetics to drive risk variant discovery, and/or apply such information to provide further mechanistic insights into disease biology, to dissect the genetic architecture of disease, to explore the impact of modifiable risk factors, and/or to support translational advances.
