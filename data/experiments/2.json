A recent paper on neural coding in the somatosensory cortex by Sofroniew et al. in eLife used Binder to share data and analyses of neural recordings. Another example is a recent paper in Nature by Li et al. on robustness to perturbation in neural circuits, which used Binder to share simulation results from a computational model. Notebooks demonstrating the discovery of gravitational waves from the LIGO group were turned into a Binder, which has been by far our most popular example."

Outside of science publications, Binder has been used to make analyses for news stories more reproducible, and even to make an entire book on data science executable. It\u2019s also become a popular way to run courses or tutorial sessions, because students can launch tutorials straight from their web browsers, without wasting precious time configuring dependencies. Physicists at CERN use it to showcase demos of their ROOT analysis framework."
