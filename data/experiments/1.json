However, a lot of this power is hidden away in the paragraph styling that is automatically applied to different parts of the document. For instance, headings are never pieces of bold text in Manuscripts, and you cannot space items out with tabs or extra linefeeds. We feel these kinds of formatting tricks are counterproductive for the author and also the publisher that receives the document, so we don\u2019t provide them. Instead, we automatically prepare the visual representation of a document as much as possible. This is a task that computers are good at, just as long as the document is structured well, and it lets the author focus on formulating an argument \u2013 which is what they are good at."

The problem with this kind of workflow is that the reference metadata easily becomes an afterthought at the writing tool end, and the manuscript becomes locked into a particular reference management tool. This makes collaboration hard, and it also leads into situations where one is no longer easily able to reformat references: the metadata is auxiliary and can get lost, leaving behind only a particular visual representation of itself in the document."

It also allows authors to use a mixture of citation tools in a collaborative process. In that sense, Manuscripts contains some of the logic that usually resides in a reference manager. It isn\u2019t however trying to be a full-blown reference manager \u2013 instead, it includes an entirely open interface to work with external citation tools."

However, we also built support for importing bibliography data from essentially all key bibliography file formats (BibTeX, EndNote XML and RIS, among many others), and there's a built-in citation tool included for inserting citations. This means that you can already use it together with pretty much any given reference manager of your choice. We are also already working with external parties to integrate other reference management tools closely with the app."

The more substantial the writing project, the more likely that offline uses become key to real-world productivity. In this sense, the present breed of collaborative scientific writing tools all require an author to make a substantial compromise between personal productivity and the need to write collaboratively, and we think we will be able to offer something unique in that respect. Indeed, the next big thing you can expect from us is a solution to collaborative writing. To give you a hint, the Manuscripts documents are already fully version-controlled in part because of upcoming collaboration features."
