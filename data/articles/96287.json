                        "text": "The role of striatal pathways in cognitive processing is unclear. We studied dorsomedial striatal cognitive processing during interval timing, an elementary cognitive task that requires mice to estimate intervals of several seconds and involves working memory for temporal rules as well as attention to the passage of time. We harnessed optogenetic tagging to record from striatal D2-dopamine receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D2-MSNs) in the indirect pathway and from D1-dopamine receptor-expressing MSNs (D1-MSNs) in the direct pathway. We found that D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs exhibited distinct dynamics over temporal intervals as quantified by principal component analyses and trial-by-trial generalized linear models. MSN recordings helped construct and constrain a four-parameter drift-diffusion computational model in which MSN ensemble activity represented the accumulation of temporal evidence. This model predicted that disrupting either D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs would increase interval timing response times and alter MSN firing. In line with this prediction, we found that optogenetic inhibition or pharmacological disruption of either D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs increased interval timing response times. Pharmacologically disrupting D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs also changed MSN dynamics and degraded trial-by-trial temporal decoding. Together, our findings demonstrate that D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs had opposing dynamics yet played complementary cognitive roles, implying that striatal direct and indirect pathways work together to shape temporal control of action. These data provide novel insight into basal ganglia cognitive operations beyond movement and have implications for human striatal diseases and therapies targeting striatal pathways.",

These subcortical nuclei are composed of two pathways defined by medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the striatum: the indirect pathway, defined by D2-dopamine receptor-expressing MSNs (D2-MSNs), and the direct pathway, defined by D1-dopamine receptor-expressing MSNs (D1-MSNs). It has been proposed that the indirect and direct pathways play opposing roles in movement (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alexander and Crutcher, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cruz et al., 2022</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kravitz et al., 2010</a>), although recent work identified how these pathways can play more complex and complementary roles (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cui et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Tecuapetla et al., 2016</a>). MSNs receive dense input from both motor and cognitive cortical areas (<a href=\"#bib4\">Averbeck et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Graybiel, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Middleton and Strick, 2000</a>), but the respective roles of D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs in cognitive processing are largely unknown. Understanding basal ganglia cognitive processing is critical for diseases affecting the striatum such as Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and schizophrenia (<a href=\"#bib3\">Andreasen, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hinton et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Narayanan and Albin, 2022</a>). Furthermore, pharmacological and brain stimulation therapies directly modulate D2-MSNs, D1-MSNs, and downstream basal ganglia structures such as the globus pallidus or subthalamic nucleus. Determining basal ganglia pathway dynamics during cognitive processes will help avoid side effects of current treatments and inspire novel therapeutic directions.",

Interval timing provides an ideal platform to study cognition in the striatum because timing (1) requires cognitive resources including working memory for temporal rules and attention to the passage of time <a href=\"#bib41\">Parker et al., 2013</a>; (2) is reliably impaired in human striatal diseases such as Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and schizophrenia <a href=\"#bib32\">Merchant and de Lafuente, 2014</a>; (3) requires nigrostriatal dopamine that modulates MSNs <a href=\"#bib16\">Emmons et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gouvêa et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Matell et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Mello et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Monteiro et al., 2023</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wang et al., 2018</a>; and (4) can be rigorously studied in animal models (<a href=\"#bib6\">Balci et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Buhusi and Meck, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kim et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Parker et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Parker et al., 2015</a>). We and others have found that striatal MSNs encode time across multiple intervals by time-dependent ramping activity or monotonic changes in firing rate across a temporal interval (<a href=\"#bib16\">Emmons et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gouvêa et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Mello et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wang et al., 2018</a>). However, the respective roles of D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs are unknown. Past work has shown that disrupting either D2-dopamine receptors (D2) or D1-dopamine receptors (D1) powerfully impairs interval timing by increasing estimates of elapsed time (<a href=\"#bib15\">Drew et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Meck, 2006</a>). Similar behavioral effects were found with systemic (<a href=\"#bib54\">Stutt et al., 2024</a>) or local infusion of D2 or D1 antagonists locally within the dorsomedial striatum (<a href=\"#bib13\">De Corte et al., 2019</a>). These data lead to the hypothesis that D2 MSNs and D1 MSNs have similar patterns of ramping activity across a temporal interval.",

Strikingly, optogenetic tagging of D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs revealed distinct neuronal dynamics, with D2-MSNs tending to increase firing over an interval and D1-MSNs tending to decrease firing over the same interval, similar to opposing movement dynamics (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cruz et al., 2022</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kravitz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Tecuapetla et al., 2016</a>). MSN dynamics helped construct and constrain a four-parameter drift-diffusion computational model of interval timing, which predicted that disrupting either D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs would increase interval timing response times. Accordingly, we found that optogenetic inhibition of either D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs increased interval timing response times. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of either D2 or D1 receptors also increased response times and degraded trial-by-trial temporal decoding from MSN ensembles. Thus, D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs have opposing temporal dynamics yet disrupting either MSN type produced similar effects on behavior. These data demonstrate how striatal pathways play complementary roles in elementary cognitive operations and are highly relevant for understanding the pathophysiology of human diseases and therapies targeting the striatum.",

On the remaining 50% of trials, mice were rewarded for nosepoking at the ‘first’ nosepoke and then switching to the ‘second’ nosepoke; initial nosepokes at the second nosepoke after 18 s triggered reward when preceded by a first nosepoke. The first nosepokes occurred before switching responses and the second nosepokes occurred much later in the interval in anticipation of reward delivery at 18 s (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B–D</a>).

                                    "text": "Striatal neuronal populations are largely composed of MSNs expressing D2- or D1-dopamine receptors. We optogenetically tagged D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs by implanting optrodes in the dorsomedial striatum and conditionally expressing channelrhodopsin (ChR2; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</a>) in four D2-Cre (two female) and five D1-Cre transgenic mice (two female). This approach expressed ChR2 in D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A, B</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kim et al., 2017</a>). We identified D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs by their response to brief pulses of 473 nm light; neurons that fired within 5 ms were considered optically tagged putative D2-MSNs (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, C</a>). We tagged 32 putative D2-MSNs and 41 putative D1-MSNs in a single recording session during interval timing. There were no consistent differences in overall firing rate between D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs (D2-MSNs: 3.4 (1.4–7.2) Hz; D1-MSNs 5.2 (3.1–8.6) Hz; <i>F</i> = 2.7, p <i>=</i> 0.11; all neuronal analyses account for variance between mice using linear mixed-effects models). Peri-event rasters and histograms from a tagged putative D2-MSN (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) and from a tagged putative D1-MSN (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) demonstrate prominent modulations for the first 6 s of the interval after trial start. <i>Z</i>-scores of average peri-event time histograms (PETHs) from 0 to 6 s after trial start for each putative D2-MSN are shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> and for each putative D1-MSN in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>. These PETHs revealed that for the 6-s interval immediately after trial start, many putative D2-MSN neurons appeared to ramp up while many putative D1-MSNs appeared to ramp down. For 32 putative D2-MSNs average PETH activity increased over the 6-s interval immediately after trial start, whereas for 41 putative D1-MSNs, average PETH activity decreased. Accordingly, D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs had differences in activity early in the interval (0–5 s; <i>F</i> = 4.5, p = 0.04 accounting for variance between mice) but not late in the interval (5–6 s; <i>F</i> = 1.9, p <i>=</i> 0.17 accounting for variance between mice). Examination of a longer interval of 10 s before to 18 s after trial start revealed the greatest separation in D2-MSN and D1-MSN dynamics during the 6-s interval after trial start (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</a>). Strikingly, these data suggest that D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs display distinct dynamics during interval timing.",

Consistent with population averages from <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G, H</a>, D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs had opposite patterns of activity with negative PC1 scores for D2-MSNs and positive PC1 scores for D1-MSNs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>; PC1 for D2-MSNs: –3.4 (−4.6 to 2.5); PC1 for D1-MSNs: 2.8 (−2.8 to 4.9); <i>F</i> = 8.8, p = 0.004 accounting for variance between mice; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</a>; Cohen’s <i>d</i> = 0.7; power = 0.80; no reliable effect of sex (<i>F</i> = 0.4, p <i>=</i> 0.51) or switching direction (<i>F</i> = 1.7, p <i>=</i> 0.19)). Importantly, PC1 scores for D2-MSNs were significantly less than 0 (signrank D2-MSN PC1 scores vs 0: p = 0.02), implying that because PC1 ramps down, D2-MSNs tended to ramp up. Conversely, PC1 scores for D1-MSNs were significantly greater than 0 (signrank D1-MSN PC1 scores vs 0: p = 0.05), implying that D1-MSNs tended to ramp down. Thus, analysis of PC1 in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A–C</a> suggested that D2-MSNs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>) and D1-MSNs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>) had opposing ramping dynamics.",

GLM analysis also demonstrated that D2-MSNs had significantly different slopes (–0.01 spikes/s (−0.10 to 0.10)), which were distinct from D1-MSNs (–0.20 (−0.47 to −0.06; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>; <i>F</i> = 8.9, p = 0.004 accounting for variance between mice; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</a>); Cohen’s <i>d</i> = 0.8; power = 0.98; no reliable effect of sex (<i>F</i> = 0.0, p <i>=</i> 0.88) or switching direction (<i>F</i> = 1.7, p <i>=</i> 0.19)).

See Methods and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</a> for how the model parameters were chosen and how we quantified the model’s explanatory power for behavior. Interestingly, we observed that two-parameter gamma distributions strongly accounted for the model dynamics (D2-MSNs: Gamma parameters <i>α</i> = 6.08, <i>β</i> = 0.69, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> Gamma vs Model = 0.99; D1-MSNs <i>α</i> = 5.89, <i>β</i> = 0.69; <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> Gamma vs Model = 0.99; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C, D</a>, dotted black lines; <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</a>). Gamma distributions also provided a surprisingly good approximation for the probability distribution and cumulative distribution functions of mouse switch response times (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B–D</a>; <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> Data vs Gamma = 0.94 for D1-MSNs and for D2-MSNs). Thus, in the next sections, we used gamma distributions as a proxy for both the distribution of times generated by the model and the distribution of mice switch response times, when comparing those for the goodness of fit. Our model provided the opportunity to computationally explore the consequences of disrupting D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs. Because both D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs accumulate temporal evidence, disrupting either MSN type in the model changed the slope. The results were obtained by simultaneously decreasing the drift rate <i>D</i> (equivalent to lengthening the neurons’ integration time constant) and lowering the level of network noise σ: <i>D</i> <math id=\"inf49\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><mo>=</mo><mn>0.129</mn><mo>,</mo><mi>σ</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0.043</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> for D2-MSNs in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> (in red; changes in noise had to accompany changes in drift rate to preserve switch response time variance.

The model predicted that disrupting either D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs would degrade the temporal accumulation of evidence, increase switch response times (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C, D</a>), and shift MSN dynamics. In the next section, we interrogated these ideas with a combination of optogenetics, behavioral pharmacology, and electrophysiology.",

We tested this idea with optogenetics.

We used PCA to quantify effects of D2 or D1 blockade (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bruce et al., 2021</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Emmons et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kim et al., 2017</a>). We constructed principal components (PCs) from <i>z</i>-scored PETHs of firing rate from saline, D2 blockade, and D1 blockade sessions for all mice together. The first component (PC1), which explained 54% of neuronal variance, exhibited ‘time-dependent ramping’, or monotonic changes over the 6-s interval immediately after trial start (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F, G</a>; variance for PC1 p = 0.001 vs 46 (45–47)% for any pattern of PC1 variance in random data; <a href=\"#bib37\">Narayanan, 2016</a>). As with the optogenetic tagging dataset, trial-by-trial GLM slopes were strongly correlated with PC1 scores (PC1 scores vs GLM slope <i>r</i> = –0.66, p = 10<sup>–14</sup>), explaining 44% of variance. Interestingly, PC1 scores shifted with D2 blockade (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>; PC1 scores for D2 blockade: –0.6 (−3.8 to 4.7) vs saline: –2.3 (−4.2 to 3.2), <i>F</i> = 5.1, p = 0.03 accounting for variance between MSNs; no reliable effect of sex (<i>F</i> = 0.2, p = 0.63) or switching direction (<i>F</i> = 2.8, p = 0.10)). PC1 scores also shifted with D1 blockade (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>; PC1 scores for D1 blockade: –0.0 (−3.9 to 4.5), <i>F</i> = 5.8, p = 0.02 accounting for variance between MSNs; no reliable effect of sex (<i>F</i> = 0.0, p = 0.93) or switching direction (<i>F</i> = 0.9, p = 0.34)). There were no reliable differences in PC1 scores between D2 and D1 blockades. Furthermore, PC1 was distinct even when sessions were sorted independently and assumed to be fully statistically independent (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</a>). Higher components explained less variance and were not reliably different between saline and D2 or D1 blockade. Taken together, this data-driven analysis shows that D2 and D1 blockades produced similar shifts in MSN population dynamics represented by PC1. When combined with the major contributions of D1/D2 MSNs to PC1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) these findings indicate that pharmacological D2 and D1 blockades disrupt ramping-related activity in the striatum.",

Strikingly, optogenetic tagging showed that D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs had distinct dynamics during interval timing. MSN dynamics helped construct and constrain a four-parameter DDM in which D2- and D1-MSN spiking accumulated temporal evidence. This model predicted that disrupting either D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs would increase switch response times. Accordingly, we found that optogenetically or pharmacologically disrupting striatal D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs increased switch response times without affecting task-specific movements. Disrupting D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs shifted MSN temporal dynamics and degraded MSN temporal decoding. These data, when combined with our model predictions, demonstrate that despite opposing dynamics, D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs contribute complementary temporal evidence to controlling actions in time. Our interpretation is that because the activity of D2-MSN and D1-MSN ensembles represents the accumulation evidence, pharmacological/optogenetic disruption of D2-MSN/D1-MSN activity slows this accumulation process, leading to slower interval timing-response times (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) without changing other task-specific movements (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</a>). These results provide new insight into how opposing patterns of striatal MSN activity control behavior in similar ways and show that they play a complementary role in elementary cognitive operations.",

Three broad models have been proposed for how striatal MSN ensembles represent time: (1) the striatal beat frequency model, in which MSNs encode temporal information based on neuronal synchrony <a href=\"#bib29\">Matell and Meck, 2004</a>; (2) the distributed coding model, in which time is represented by the state of the network <a href=\"#bib45\">Paton and Buonomano, 2018</a>; and (3) the DDM, in which neuronal activity monotonically drifts toward a threshold after which responses are initiated (<a href=\"#bib16\">Emmons et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Simen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wang et al., 2018</a>). While our data do not formally resolve these possibilities, our results show that D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs exhibit opposing changes in firing rate dynamics in PC1 over the interval. Past work by our group and others has demonstrated that PC1 dynamics can scale over multiple intervals to represent time (<a href=\"#bib18\">Emmons et al., 2020</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Emmons et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gouvêa et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Mello et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wang et al., 2018</a>). We find that low parameter DDMs account for interval timing behavior with both intact and disrupted striatal D2- and D1-MSNs. While other models can capture interval timing behavior and account for MSN neuronal activity, our model does so parsimoniously with relatively few parameters (<a href=\"#bib29\">Matell and Meck, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Paton and Buonomano, 2018</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Simen et al., 2011</a>).

For instance, stimulating D1-MSNs facilitates movement, whereas stimulating D2-MSNs impairs movement (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kravitz et al., 2010</a>). Both populations have been shown to have complementary patterns of activity during movements with MSNs firing at different phases of action initiation and selection (<a href=\"#bib55\">Tecuapetla et al., 2016</a>). Further dissection of action selection programs reveals that opposing patterns of activation among D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs suppress and guide actions, respectively, in the dorsolateral striatum (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cruz et al., 2022</a>). A particular advantage of interval timing is that it captures a cognitive behavior within a single dimension — time. When projected along the temporal dimension, it was surprising that D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs had opposing patterns of activity. Ramping activity in the prefrontal cortex can increase or decrease and prefrontal neurons project to and control striatal ramping activity (<a href=\"#bib18\">Emmons et al., 2020</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Emmons et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wang et al., 2018</a>). It is possible that differences in D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs reflect differences in cortical ramping, which may themselves reflect more complex integrative or accumulatory processes. Further experiments are required to investigate these differences. Past pharmacological work from our group and others has shown that disrupting D2- or D1-MSNs slows timing (<a href=\"#bib13\">De Corte et al., 2019</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Drew et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Drew et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Stutt et al., 2024</a>) and are in agreement with pharmacological and optogenetic results in this manuscript.

Our task version has been used extensively to study interval timing in mice and humans (<a href=\"#bib6\">Balci et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bruce et al., 2021</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Stutt et al., 2024</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Tosun et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Weber et al., 2023</a>). However, temporal bisection tasks, in which animals hold during a temporal cue and respond at different locations depending on cue length, have advantages in studying how animals time an interval because animals are not moving while estimating cue duration (<a href=\"#bib45\">Paton and Buonomano, 2018</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Robbe, 2023</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Soares et al., 2016</a>). Our interval timing task version – in which mice switch between two response nosepokes to indicate their interval estimate has elapsed – has been used extensively in rodent models of neurodegenerative disease (<a href=\"#bib26\">Larson et al., 2022</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Weber et al., 2024a</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Weber et al., 2023</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Zhang et al., 2021</a>), as well as in humans (<a href=\"#bib54\">Stutt et al., 2024</a>). This version of interval timing involves temporal control of movements, which engages executive function and has more translational relevance for human diseases than perceptual timing or bisection tasks (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brown, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Farajzadeh and Sanayei, 2024</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Zhang et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Singh et al., 2021</a>). Many therapeutics targeting dopamine receptors are used clinically, and our findings help describe how dopaminergic drugs might affect striatal function and dysfunction.

                            "text": "Our approach has several limitations. First, systemic drug injections block D2 and D1 receptors in many different brain regions, including the frontal cortex, which is involved in interval timing (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kim et al., 2017</a>). Our past work locally infused drugs blocking D2- and D1-dopamine receptors within the dorsomedial striatum, and found increased response times during interval timing as in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> (<a href=\"#bib13\">De Corte et al., 2019</a>). Pharmacological interventions may have complex effects that might affect D2-MSN or D1-MSN ensembles. We note that optogenetic inhibition of D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs produces similar effects to pharmacology in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>. Pharmacology is compatible with neuronal ensemble recordings as optogenetic inhibition would silence a large fraction of neurons, complicating interpretations. Future studies might extend our work by combining local pharmacology with neuronal ensemble recording. Second, although we had adequate statistical power and medium-to-large effect sizes, optogenetic tagging is low yield, and it is possible that recording more of these neurons would afford greater opportunity to identify more robust results and alternative coding schemes, such as neuronal synchrony. Recording more neurons simultaneously would also help further constrain DDMs to predict trial-by-trial firing rate and generate a more sophisticated neuronal network model of time (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</a>). There was some variability within animals (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</a>), although some of this variability was explained by firing rate slope and whether MSNs ramped or down (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C, D</a>). Third, the striatum includes diverse cell types, some of which express both D1- and D2-dopamine receptors; these cell types may also contribute to cognitive processing. Fourth, MSNs can laterally inhibit each other, which may profoundly affect striatal function. Regardless, we show that cell-type-specific disruption of D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs both slow timing, implying that these cell types play a key role in interval timing. Future experiments may record from non-MSN striatal cell types, including fast-spiking interneurons that shape basal ganglia output. Fifth, we did not deliver stimulation to the striatum because our pilot experiments triggered movement artifacts or task-specific dyskinesias (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kravitz et al., 2010</a>). Stimulation approaches carefully titrated to striatal physiology may affect interval timing without affecting movement. Finally, movement and motivation can contribute to MSN dynamics (<a href=\"#bib46\">Robbe, 2023</a>). Four lines of evidence argue that our findings cannot be directly explained by motor confounds: (1) D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs diverge between 0 and 6 s after trial start well before the first nosepoke (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</a>), (2) our GLM accounted for nosepokes and nosepoke-related βs were similar between D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs, (3) optogenetic disruption of dorsomedial D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs did not change task-specific movements despite reliable changes in switch response time, and (4) ramping dynamics were quite distinct from movement dynamics. Furthermore, disrupting D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs did not change the number of rewards animals received, implying that these disruptions did not grossly affect motivation. Still, future work combining motion tracking/accelerometry with neuronal ensemble recording and optogenetics and including bisection tasks may further unravel timing vs movement in MSN dynamics (<a href=\"#bib46\">Robbe, 2023</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Tecuapetla et al., 2016</a>).",

In concordance with this prediction, we found that optogenetic or pharmacological disruption of either D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs increased switch response times, with pharmacological D2 or D1 blockade shifting MSN dynamics and degrading temporal decoding.

Briefly, mice were trained in sound-attenuating operant chambers, with two front nosepokes flanking either side of a food hopper on the front wall, and a third nosepoke located at the center of the back wall. The chamber was positioned below an 8 kHz, 72 dB speaker (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; MedAssociates, St. Albans, VT). Mice were 85% food restricted and motivated with 20 mg sucrose pellets (Bio-Serv, Flemington, NJ). Mice were initially trained to receive rewards during fixed ratio nosepoke response trials. Nosepoke entry and exit were captured by infrared beams. After shaping, mice were trained in the ‘switch’ interval timing task. Mice self-initiated trials at the back nosepoke, after which tone and nosepoke lights were illuminated simultaneously. Cues were identical on all trial types and lasted the entire duration of the trial (6 or 18 s). On 50% of trials, mice were rewarded for a nosepoke after 6 s at the designated first ‘front’ nosepoke; these trials were not analyzed. On the remaining 50% of trials, mice were rewarded for nosepoking first at the ‘first’ nosepoke location and then switching to the ‘second’ nosepoke location; the reward was delivered for initial nosepokes at the second nosepoke location after 18 s when preceded by a nosepoke at the first nosepoke location. Multiple nosepokes at each nosepoke were allowed. Early responses at the first or second nosepoke were not reinforced. Initial responses at the second nosepoke rather than the first nosepoke, alternating between nosepokes, going back to the first nosepoke after the second nosepoke were rare after initial training. Error trials included trials where animals responded only at the first or second nosepoke and were also not reinforced.

That is, mice estimate if more than 6 s have elapsed without receiving a reward to decide to switch responses. Mice learn this task quickly (3–4 weeks), and error trials in which an animal nosepokes in the wrong order or does not nosepoke are relatively rare and discarded. Consequently, we focused on these switch response times as the key metric for temporal control of action. <i>Traversal time</i> was defined as the duration between first nosepoke exit and second nosepoke entry and is distinct from switch response time when animals departed the first nosepoke. <i>Nosepoke duration</i> was defined as the time between first nosepoke entry and exit for the switch response times only.

For optogenetic tagging, putative D1- and D2-MSNs were optically identified via 473 nm photostimulation (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</a>). Units with mean post-stimulation spike latencies of ≤5 ms and a stimulated-to-unstimulated waveform correlation ratio of &gt;0.9 were classified as putative D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs (<a href=\"#bib47\">Ryan et al., 2018</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Shin et al., 2018</a>).

In this task, animals must first nose poke into a cued port on the left or right; if not rewarded after 6 seconds, they must switch to the other port. Thus, this task requires animals to estimate if at least 6 seconds have passed after the first nose poke. After verifying that animals estimate the passage of 6 seconds, the authors examine striatal activity during this interval. They report that D1-MSNs tend to decrease activity, while D2MSNs increase activity, throughout this interval. They suggest that this activity follows a driftdiffusion model, in which activity increases (or decreases) to a threshold after which a decision is made. The authors next report that optogenetically inhibiting D1 or D2 MSNs, or pharmacologically blocking D1 and D2 receptors, increased the average wait time. This suggests that both D1 and D2 neurons contribute to the estimate of time, with a decrease in their activity corresponding to a decrease in the rate of 'drift' in their drift-diffusion model. Lastly, the authors examine MSN activity while pharmacologically inhibiting D1 or D2 receptors. The authors observe most recorded MSNs neurons decrease their activity over the interval, with the rate decreasing with D1/D2 receptor inhibition.",

The question posed by the authors - how striatal activity contributes to interval timing - is of importance to the field and has been the focus of many studies and labs. This paper contributes to that line of work by investigating whether D1 and D2 neurons have similar activity patterns during the timed interval, as might be expected based on prior work based on striatal manipulations. However, the authors find that D1 and D2 neurons have distinct activity patterns. They then provide a decision-making model that is consistent with all results. The data within the paper is presented very clearly, and the authors have done a nice job presenting the data in a transparent manner (e.g., showing individual cells and animals). Overall, the manuscript is relatively easy to read and clear, with sufficient detail given in most places regarding the experimental paradigm or analyses used.",

Three broad models have been proposed for how striatal MSN ensembles represent time: (1) the striatal beat frequency model, in which MSNs encode temporal information based on neuronal synchrony Matell and Meck, 2004; (2) the distributed coding model, in which time is represented by the state of the network Paton and Buonomano, 2018; and (3) the DDM, in which neuronal activity monotonically drifts toward a threshold after which responses are initiated (Emmons et al., 2017; Simen et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2018). While our data do not formally resolve these possibilities, our results show that D2-MSNs and D1MSNs exhibit opposing changes in firing rate dynamics in PC1 over the interval. Past work by our group and others has demonstrated that PC1 dynamics can scale over multiple intervals to represent time (Emmons et al., 2020, 2017; Gouvea et al., 2015; Mello et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2018). We find that low-parameter DDMs account for interval timing behavior with both intact and disrupted striatal D2- and D1-MSNs. While other models can capture interval timing behavior and account for MSN neuronal activity, our model does so parsimoniously with relatively few parameters (Matell and Meck, 2004; Paton and Buonomano, 2018; Simen et al., 2011). We and others have shown previously that ramping activity scales to multiple intervals, and DDMs can be readily adapted by changing the drift rate (Emmons et al., 2017; Gouvea et al., 2015; Mello et al., 2015; Simen et al., 2011). Interestingly, decoding performance was high early in the interval; indeed, animals may have been focused on this initial interval (Balci and Gallistel, 2006) in making temporal comparisons and deciding whether to switch response nosepokes.”",

These patterns have been seen in motor control. Prefrontal neurons, which control striatal ramping, also ramp up and down. We have now included a paragraph on Page 30 explicitly discussing these ideas; however, future experiments will be required to investigate the source of the divergent patterns of activity among D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs.",

For instance, stimulating D1-MSNs facilitates movement, whereas stimulating D2-MSNs impairs movement (Kravitz et al., 2010). Both populations have been shown to have complementary patterns of activity during movements with MSNs firing at different phases of action initiation and selection (Tecuapetla et al., 2016). Further dissection of action selection programs reveals that opposing patterns of activation among D2MSNs and D1-MSNs suppress and guide actions, respectively, in the dorsolateral striatum (Cruz et al., 2022). A particular advantage of interval timing is that it captures a cognitive behavior within a single dimension — time. When projected along the temporal dimension, it was surprising that D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs had opposing patterns of activity. Ramping activity in the prefrontal cortex can increase or decrease; and prefrontal neurons project to and control striatal ramping activity (Emmons et al., 2020, 2017; Wang et al., 2018). It is possible that differences in D2MSNs and D1-MSNs reflect differences in cortical ramping, which may themselves reflect more complex integrative or accumulatory processes. Further experiments are required to investigate these differences. Past pharmacological work from our group and others has shown that disrupting D2- or D1-MSNs slows timing (De Corte et al., 2019b; Drew et al., 2007, 2003; Stutt et al., 2024) and are in agreement with pharmacological and optogenetic results in this manuscript. Computational modeling predicted that disrupting either D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs increased selfreported estimates of time, which was supported by both optogenetic and pharmacological experiments.”",

In Figure 3, a different analysis is done, and this time D2 neurons do not significantly increase their activity with time, conflicting with Figure 2. While in both figures, there is a significant difference between the mean slopes across the population, the secondary effect of positive/negative slope for D2/D1 neurons changes.

We recognized that the mean 𝝁𝑴 and the coefficient of variation 𝑪𝑽𝑴 are directly related to the shape and rate of the Gamma distribution by formulas 𝝁𝑴 = 𝜶𝑴/𝜷𝑴 and 𝑪𝑽𝑴 = 𝟏/√𝜶𝑴.

For each pair (𝑫, 𝝈), one computational “experiment” generated 500 response times with mean 𝝁 and coefficient of variation 𝑪𝑽. We repeated the “experiment” 10 times and took the group median of 𝝁 and 𝑪𝑽 to obtain the simulation-based statistical measures 𝝁𝑺 and 𝑪𝑽𝑺. Last, we plotted 𝑬𝝁 = |(𝝁𝑺 − 𝝁𝑴)/𝝁𝑴| and 𝑬𝒄𝒗 = |𝑪𝑽𝑺 − 𝑪𝑽𝑴|, the respective relative error and the absolute error to data (Fig S7).

However, despite its importance, the extent to which different projection pathways of the striatum contribute to this information processing remains unclear. In this paper, Bruce et al. conducted a study using various causal and correlational techniques to investigate how these pathways collectively contribute to interval timing in mice. Their results were consistent with previous research, showing that the direct and indirect striatal pathways perform opposing roles in processing elapsed time. Based on their findings, the authors proposed a revised computational model in which two separate accumulators track evidence for elapsed time in opposing directions. These results have significant implications for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in neurological and psychiatric disorders, as disruptions in the balance between direct and indirect pathway activity are commonly observed in such conditions.",

This has been shown to cause adverse effects on population activity (for example, through heating the tissue) that are not necessarily related to their function during the task epochs.

However, temporal bisection tasks, in which animals hold during a temporal cue and respond at different locations depending on cue length, have advantages in studying how animals time an interval because animals are not moving while estimating cue duration (Paton and Buonomano, 2018; Robbe, 2023; Soares et al., 2016). Our interval timing task version – in which mice switch between two response nosepokes to indicate their interval estimate has elapsed – has been used extensively in rodent models of neurodegenerative disease (Larson et al., 2022; Weber et al., 2024, 2023; Zhang et al., 2021), as well as in humans (Stutt et al., 2024). This version of interval timing involves motor timing, which engages executive function and has more translational relevance for human diseases than perceptual timing or bisection tasks (Brown, 2006; Farajzadeh and Sanayei, 2024; Nombela et al., 2016; Singh et al., 2021). Furthermore, because many therapeutics targeting dopamine receptors are used clinically, these findings help describe how dopaminergic drugs might affect cognitive function and dysfunction. Future studies of D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs in temporal bisection and other timing tasks may further clarify the relative roles of D2- and D1-MSNs in interval timing and time estimation.”",

In this task, animals must first nosepoke into a cued port on the left or right; if not rewarded after 6 seconds, they must switch to the other port. Thus, this task requires animals to estimate if at least 6 seconds have passed after the first nosepoke. After verifying that animals estimate the passage of 6 seconds, the authors examine striatal activity during this interval. They report that D1-MSNs tend to decrease activity, while D2-MSNs increase activity, throughout this interval. They suggest that this activity follows a drift-diffusion model, in which activity increases (or decreases) to a threshold after which a decision is made. The authors next report that optogenetically inhibiting D1 or D2 MSNs, or pharmacologically blocking D1 and D2 receptors, increased the average wait time. This suggests that both D1 and D2 neurons contribute to the estimate of time, with a decrease in their activity corresponding to a decrease in the rate of 'drift' in their drift-diffusion model. Lastly, the authors examine MSN activity while pharmacologically inhibiting D1 or D2 receptors. The authors observe most recorded MSNs neurons decrease their activity over the interval, with the rate decreasing with D1/D2 receptor inhibition.",

This paper contributes to that line of work by investigating whether D1 and D2 neurons have similar activity patterns during the timed interval, as might be expected based on prior work based on striatal manipulations. However, the authors find that D1 and D2 neurons have distinct activity patterns. They then provide a decision-making model that is consistent with all results. The data within the paper is presented very clearly, and the authors have done a nice job presenting the data in a transparent manner (e.g., showing individual cells and animals).

However, despite its importance, the extent to which different projection pathways of the striatum contribute to this information processing remains unclear. In this paper, Bruce et al. conducted a study using various causal and correlational techniques to investigate how these pathways collectively contribute to interval timing in mice. Their results were consistent with previous research, showing that the direct and indirect striatal pathways perform opposing roles in processing elapsed time. Based on their findings, the authors proposed a revised computational model in which two separate accumulators track evidence for elapsed time in opposing directions. These results have significant implications for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in neurological and psychiatric disorders, as disruptions in the balance between direct and indirect pathway activity are commonly observed in such conditions.",
