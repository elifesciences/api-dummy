Building on a previously published zoonotic niche map (Pigott et al., 2014), this study incorporates new human and animal occurrence data and expands upon the way in which potential bat EVD reservoir species are incorporated. This update demonstrates the potential for incorporating and updating data used to generate the predicted suitability map. A new data portal for sharing such maps is discussed. This output represents the most up-to-date estimate of the extent of EVD zoonotic risk in Africa. These maps can assist in strengthening surveillance and response capacity to contain viral haemorrhagic fevers."

In 2014 a zoonotic niche map for Ebola virus disease (EVD) was produced (Pigott et al., 2014) in part to assess the expected geographical extent of spillover risk. This research was then expanded to explore how changes in demography and international connectivity may have facilitated the establishment and rapid subsequent spread of the epidemic (Bogoch et al., 2015). The West African outbreak of EVD has again highlighted key information gaps that exist with respect to the broader epidemiology of Ebola virus, particularly concerning viral persistence in reservoirs (Funk and Piot, 2014; Mari Saez et al., 2015; Leendertz, 2016), and prompted a variety of questions concerning the role bats play in transmission (Leendertz et al., 2016). Identifying reservoirs of zoonotic disease is a complex process (Viana et al., 2014; Haydon et al., 2002) and whilst considerable sampling effort has been undertaken over the years (Kuhn, 2008; Leirs et al., 1999), isolation of Ebolavirus from living animals has been rare (Leroy et al., 2005). The original eLife study only incorporated the three bat species found to be RNA-positive (Leroy et al., 2005). Whilst this remains currently the best evidence for an animal reservoir species, it is important to consider that other sampling efforts may by chance represent false negatives, particularly if infection is rare."

Bats remained the priority mammalian order given the previous viral isolation and the repeated anecdotal implications in previous outbreaks (Leroy et al., 2009; Mari Saez et al., 2015). Since there are a large number of bat species found in Africa, we defined three groupings, based upon the strength of evidence supporting their potential Ebola reservoir status. As a result, not only were the original three RNA-positive bats included (Leroy et al., 2005), but also those species with serological evidence of EVD infection (Olival and Hayman, 2014) and those identified through trait-based machine learning approaches as being similar to species already reporting filoviral infection (Han et al., 2016)."

Of these new occurrences, two in southern Central African Republic are found in areas predicted to be at-risk by the previous model (Pigott et al., 2014), with the index case from the Democratic Republic of Congo located in close proximity (&lt;10 km) to at-risk areas. The occurrences in Zambia and northern Central African Republic lie, respectively, to the south and north of previously predicted at-risk regions."
