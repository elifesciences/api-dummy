        "text": "Beneficial and deleterious mutations cause the fitness of lineages to vary across a phylogeny and thereby shape its branching structure. While standard phylogenetic models do not allow mutations to feedback and shape trees, birth-death models can account for this feedback by letting the fitness of lineages depend on their type. To date, these multi-type birth-death models have only been applied to cases where a lineage's fitness is determined by a single character state. We extend these models to track sequence evolution at multiple sites. This approach remains computationally tractable by tracking the genotype and fitness of lineages probabilistically in an approximate manner. Although approximate, we show that we can accurately estimate the fitness of lineages and site-specific mutational fitness effects from phylogenies. We apply this approach to estimate the population-level fitness effects of mutations in Ebola and influenza virus, and compare our estimates with in vitro fitness measurements for these mutations.",
