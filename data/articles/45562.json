Studies exploring the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) in a wide range of organisms have revealed that, while many mutations are neutral, a smaller but significant fraction have substantial effects on fitness (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sanjuán et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Eyre-Walker and Keightley, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Visher et al., 2016</a>). These findings have spurred interest in molecular evolutionary models that consider how non-neutral mutations shape sequence evolution and patterns of genetic diversity. Such models range in complexity from simple models assuming that selection operates uniformly across all sites (<a href=\"#bib28\">Muse and Gaut, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Goldman and Yang, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Yang and Nielsen, 2008</a>) to parameter rich models with site-specific fitness effects (<a href=\"#bib15\">Halpern and Bruno, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lartillot and Philippe, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Rodrigue et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hilton and Bloom, 2018</a>). While all of these models assume sequences evolve along an underlying phylogenetic tree representing their shared common ancestry, all also assume that the mutation process driving sequence evolution is independent of the other evolutionary processes giving rise to the tree. This independence assumption implies that mutations do not feedback and affect the fitness of lineages in the tree, such that lineages carrying highly beneficial mutations are just as likely to survive and produce sampled descendants as lineages riddled with deleterious mutations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).",

A common argument invoked in defense of ignoring non-neutral mutations is that macroevolutionary tree generating processes like speciation and extinction play out on longer timescales than the substitution process fixing or removing mutations within a population (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bustamante, 2005</a>). In this case, fitness variation drives the substitution process within a population but does not ultimately drive the formation of a phylogeny at the species level. But such separation-of-timescales arguments do not hold when segregating mutations contribute to substantial fitness variation between lineages in a phylogeny, such as for rapidly evolving microbes where several different mutant strains can co-circulate. In these cases, the tree generating and mutation processes occur on the same timescale, and the fitness effects of mutations can feedback and shape the branching structure of a phylogeny (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kaplan et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Nicolaisen and Desai, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Neher and Hallatschek, 2013</a>). Ignoring non-neutral evolution in this case may introduce biases into phylogenetic inference. But perhaps more importantly, fitness differences among lineages can be correlated with ancestral genotypes, providing information about the molecular basis of adaptive evolution we would otherwise ignore.",

Under this approach, mutations can directly impact the fitness of a lineage in the phylogeny by altering its birth or death rate (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). For a single evolving site or other character state, the joint likelihood of the phylogeny together with the observed tip states can be computed exactly under the MTBD model (<a href=\"#bib27\">Maddison et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Stadler and Bonhoeffer, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kühnert et al., 2016</a>). However, this approach is impractical for more than a few non-neutrally evolving sites due to the need to track all possible genotypes as separate types in the state space of the model. We therefore explore an approximate birth-death model that considers how mutations at multiple sites contribute to a lineage’s overall fitness, without the need to track all possible genotypes in sequence space. This approach allows us to infer the fitness effects of individual mutations and the fitness of any particular lineage at any time (based on its inferred ancestral genotype) from the branching structure of a phylogeny. Because our approach is particularly relevant to rapidly adapting microbial pathogens, we apply it to Ebola and influenza virus sequence data in order to quantify the fitness effects of naturally occurring amino acid substitutions.",

In the approach described below and outlined in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, we therefore track molecular evolution at each site, computing the probability that each site occupies each state, and then approximate the probability of a lineage being in any particular genotype based on these site probabilities. To compute the expected fitness of a lineage, we can then sum, or marginalize, over the fitness of each genotype weighted by its approximate probability.

The Matlab implementation was used to test how well the MFBD model can approximate likelihoods and genotype probabilities relative to the exact multi-type birth death model tracking all possible genotypes for a simple model with only four genotypes. For statistical inference, the MFBD was implemented as an add-on package for BEAST 2 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bouckaert et al., 2014</a>) named Lumière, which extends the existing BDMM package for multi-type birth-death models (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kühnert et al., 2016</a>). BEAST two is a general software platform that allows a wide range of evolutionary models including birth-death models to be fit to phylogenetic trees while jointly inferring the phylogeny using Bayesian MCMC sampling. The BEAST 2 implementation of Lumière therefore allows the joint posterior distribution of all parameters in the MFBD model and the phylogeny to be estimated from sequence data.

Because our methods cannot estimate fitness effects of mutations at very low frequencies, we only analyzed 9 of these mutations that were present in at least 10 of the 1610 viral samples. Preliminary analysis revealed that these mutations fall within eight unique genetic backgrounds because of the way mutations are nested within other single or double mutant lineages in the phylogeny.

At the population-level, this mutation appears to have a less dramatic effect, increasing transmissibility by only 5% relative to the Makona genotype. The P330S mutation appears to have temporarily decreased the fitness of the main surviving clade in lineage A, although mutations N107D and G480D later rescue the fitness of this lineage, consistent with the findings of <a href=\"#bib48\">Urbanowicz et al.

We found no evidence that transmission rates differed by location; relative transmission rates were 1.01 (95% CI: 0.97–1.05) in Sierra Leone and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.94–1.04) in Liberia compared with Guinea. All mutant genotypes had higher estimated fitness relative to the Makona genotype under the model with geographic effects due to a lower estimated fitness of the Makona genotype. However, the rank order of genotypic fitness values is consistent across models (<a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>). Overall, the population level fitness of all eight genotypes agree with their fitness in cell culture in terms of the sign or direction of their effects, but these genotypes had much greater fitness relative to the Makona genotype in cell culture than at the population level.",

Accounting for these fitness differences results in the MFBD model informed by the DMS data fitting the H3N2 phylogeny substantially better (Log likelihood: −4184) than a model assuming all mutations are neutral (Log likelihood: −7510). As would be expected, lineages predicted to be more fit also tend to persist between influenza seasons.

Historically, one of the most pervasive yet biologically questionable of these assumptions has been that sequences evolve neutrally along lineages, such the mutations do not feedback and alter the branching process shaping the phylogeny. Our marginal fitness birth-death (MFBD) model allows us to relax this core assumption in order to consider how non-neutral evolution at multiple sites affects sequence evolution, the fitness of lineages, and the overall branching structure of a phylogeny. While our approach is not exact in that it approximates genotype probabilities by assuming sites evolve independently when computing the marginal fitness of a lineage, we have shown that this approximation generally works well and only produces significant errors in rather extreme situations, such as the four genotype model with very strong selection or epistasis. While an earlier approach based on birth-death models allowed for lineage-specific fitness values to be inferred from the branching pattern of a phylogeny (<a href=\"#bib29\">Neher et al., 2014</a>), this approach did not connect fitness back to the mutational process nor allow for the fitness effects of individual mutations or genotypes to be estimated. Using our approach, we demonstrated that the fitness effects of specific mutations can be estimated from simulated phylogenies under the MFBD with accuracy comparable to an exact multi-type birth death model. The MFBD model therefore provides a new, statistically powerful way of incorporating adaptive molecular evolution into phylodynamics.",

These approaches rely on comparing sequence substitution patterns such as the dN/dS ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions across sites. These approaches can be very powerful when sequences from highly divergent taxa are compared, such that enough time has elapsed for multiple substitutions at a single site to have accumulated between lineages. But on the shorter timescales relevant to evolution within a population, substitution patterns like the dN/dS ratio are relatively insensitive to selection pressures and may produce misleading inferences of selection (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kryazhimskiy and Plotkin, 2008</a>). For example, a highly beneficial non-synonymous mutation that occurs in a single lineage and then spreads through a population may produce a very low dN/dS ratio, indicative of purifying selection rather than adaptive evolution. In contrast, comparing the evolutionary dynamics of lineages with and without the mutation allows us to infer if that mutation confers a competitive advantage. Thus, considering the branching pattern of phylogenies provides additional information about molecular evolution not visible from substitution patterns in sequence data alone.",

This is especially pertinent for emerging pathogens whose epidemic potential often depends on new adaptive mutations (<a href=\"#bib1\">Antia et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Longdon et al., 2014</a>). Phylodynamic approaches like the MFBD model that can quantify fitness at the host population level are therefore greatly needed, as they offer a means to assess the epidemiological significance of mutant lineages. Extrapolating from our experience with Ebola, where the population-level fitness effects of each mutant genotype we considered matched the sign of their effect in cell culture, we suspect that fitness measured in the lab will generally agree with fitness in nature. This seems reasonable, as mutations that increase replication or cellular infectivity within hosts should generally promote transmissibility between hosts (e.g. <a href=\"#bib33\">Quinn et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Fraser et al., 2007</a>). But at the same time, there is no reason to believe that transmission rates will increase linearly or even monotonically with increasing within-host growth rates. We therefore expect that the magnitude of fitness effects might often greatly differ across scales, as we found for the A82V glycoprotein mutation in Ebola. While A82V doubles infectivity in cell culture, we estimated that it only increases transmissibility at the population level by 5% (95% CI: 4–7%). Interestingly, (<a href=\"#bib5\">Diehl et al., 2016</a>) found that A82V only slightly increases viral titers in Ebola patients, which is likely a much better proxy for transmissibility than cellular infectivity, lending support to our more moderate estimates at the population level.",

We believe that these inference problems likely stem from the fact that many of these mutations occur only once in the phylogeny and in the same genetic background as other mutations in the HA protein. The shared phylogenetic ancestry of mutations creates an identifiability problem akin to the problem of collinearity in more standard regression-type models. In either case, the individual effects of highly correlated variables are difficult or impossible to infer. Nevertheless, including the mutational fitness effects predicted by deep mutational scanning experiments improved the fit of the MFBD model to the H3N2 phylogeny by thousands of log likelihood units. Accounting for these fitness effects in the MFBD model also revealed substantial variation in population-level fitness among viral lineages within a single antigenic cluster. Most lineages were reconstructed to have a slightly deleterious mutation load, consistent with earlier reports that background variation in fitness arising from deleterious mutations, not just antigenic mutations, plays a large role in determining which H3N2 lineages ultimately persist (<a href=\"#bib17\">Illingworth and Mustonen, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Luksza and Lässig, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Koelle and Rasmussen, 2015</a>). Moreover, the fitness variation uncovered by our analysis likely represents only the ‘tip of the iceberg’, since there are likely mutations in other genomic segments besides HA with large fitness effects (<a href=\"#bib35\">Raghwani et al., 2017</a>), which we did not consider.",

Increasing the number of sites under consideration also increases the complexity of the genetic background in which mutations occur due to the increased probability of mutations being linked to other mutations rather than occurring in isolation. This leads to strong correlations between the fitness effects of different sites in an increasingly high dimensional parameter space, making statistical inference challenging, especially using MCMC methods. Spurious correlations may also arise due to additional, unmodeled sources of fitness variation. For example, if a mutation occurs coincidently with another beneficial mutation or the mutation occurs by chance along a lineage spreading through a higher fitness environment, it will likely be inferred to increase fitness even if it is actually neutral. In the future, the MFBD should therefore be extended to account for unmodeled sources of fitness variation. For example, each lineage could be assigned a random fitness effect representing the unmodeled components of fitness variation. These random effects could then be modeled as a continuous trait evolving along lineages, such that more closely related lineages would be expected to have similar fitness and overly large changes between closely related lineages would be penalized. Such a model would then allow us to say whether a fitness effect attributed to a particular mutation could be equally well explained by random effects arising from unmodeled fitness variation. Until such a principled approach is implemented, the fitness effects of individual mutations need to be interpreted carefully unless they occur in multiple genetic backgrounds and confounding sources of fitness variation can be accounted for, as we tried to do for Ebola by including potentially confounding geographic fitness effects.",

The MFBD model can also be used to compare the fitness of a mutation or lineage across different environments, such as in different hosts of a pathogen. Finally, the MFBD is not limited to exploring sequence evolution, as the model is generalizable to any discrete character state, including phenotypic, geographic or environmental characters. Thus, more generally, our model can be thought of as a multi-trait, multi-type birth-death model that can be used to explore how different molecular and non-molecular characters interact to shape the overall fitness of lineages in a phylogeny.",

In our opinion, given the scope of <i>eLife</i> and that many readers will probably be less expert in probability theory than the reviewers, we think it is extremely important to be very clear about the assumptions and where the method works and where it falls short (see comments by reviewer 2). In light of this, reviewer 1 comments that testing different systems will provide such intuition for the less mathematically trained.

The authors first introduce a general set of coupled different equations for the backwards evolution of the probabilities of observed subtrees and non-observed lineages. As these equations are intractable, a series of approximations to reduce the size of the problem are considered, including projections onto low-dimensional subspaces, decorrelation between sites in the genome… These simplified equations are solved in three cases: two toy models (small number of sites), for which the ground truth is known, and Ebola glycoprotein (GP) data sampled during the 2013-16 epidemic.

While some compromise has always to be made between a full, self-contained presentation and the necessity to have a reasonable length, I think the manuscript should be made more accessible. I had to go to Stadler and Bonhoeffer (2013) to understand clearly the meaning of the main quantities (D<sub>n,i</sub> and E<sub>i</sub>); inserting a figure similar to Figure 1 of that paper would be useful. Equations 2 and 3, which are identical to the ones of Stadler and Bonhoeffer (apart from the presence of mutations – γ<sub>i,j</sub> – instead of lineage – λ<sub>i,j</sub> – rates), are also better explained in that paper. Furthermore, the presence of the normalization factor including the probability of being observed in Equation 5 is not really explained here.

A far more likely reason for this decline is that the complexity of the genetic background in which mutations occur increases with more sites. Mutations therefore start to occur in the same genetic background as other mutations, making it difficult to estimate the effects of individual mutations. This leads to more uncertainty and variability in our estimates of site-specific effects, which explains the loss of accuracy with increasing numbers of sites.",

I wonder how much such effects could influence the predictions for the fitness effects output by the algorithm. To be more specific, suppose that the fitness f changes by some epsilon (depending on the lineage n), how much would the D and E probabilities change? I expect that this could be studied numerically in the small size models, or even analytically with linear-response theory. Assessing the robustness of the predictions against slight variations in the sequence-to-fitness relation is an important issue.",
