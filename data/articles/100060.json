Validating causative genes and understanding their mechanisms remain challenging. We assessed a semi-high throughput zebrafish screening platform for rapid in vivo functional testing of candidate FBD genes. Six genes linked to severe recessive osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) and four associated with bone mineral density (BMD) from genome-wide association studies were analyzed. Using CRISPR/Cas9-based crispant screening in F0 mosaic founder zebrafish, Next-generation sequencing confirmed high indel efficiency (mean 88%), mimicking stable knock-out models. Skeletal phenotyping at 7, 14, and 90 days post-fertilization (dpf) using microscopy, Alizarin Red S staining, and microCT was performed. Larval crispants showed variable osteoblast and mineralization phenotypes, while adult crispants displayed consistent skeletal defects, including malformed neural and haemal arches, vertebral fractures and fusions, and altered bone volume and density. In addition, aldh7a1 and mbtps2 crispants experienced increased mortality due to severe skeletal deformities. RT-qPCR revealed differential expression of osteogenic markers bglap and col1a1a, highlighting their biomarker potential. Our results establish zebrafish crispant screening as a robust tool for FBD gene validation, combining skeletal and molecular analyses across developmental stages to uncover novel insights into gene functions in bone biology.",

The conservation between human and zebrafish is reported in the last column. The first four genes are associated with the pathogenesis of osteoporosis, while the last six are linked to osteogenesis imperfecta. (b) Assessment of off-target effects in crispants. Genes that are possibly targeted by the selected crRNA for each of the crispants are called ‘off-target genes’ in this table (mm=number of mismatches). The top 3 ranked off-target effects, selected based on a high CFD (cutting frequency determination) score, are listed, together with their chromosomal position, forward and reverse primer for amplification, the CFD (cutting frequency determination) score and the off-target percentage, based on NGS analysis of a pool of DNA of 1-day old crispants (n=10). (c) Crispant genotyping. Crispant genes with crRNA sequence, forward and reverse primers and assay specifications for Next-generation sequencing (NGS) are listed in this table. The first four genes are associated with the pathogenesis of osteoporosis, while the last six are linked to osteogenesis imperfecta. Primers are designed using Primer3 (<a href=\"https://primer3.ut.ee\">https://primer3.ut.ee</a>). (d) qPCR primers.

They present within a wide phenotypic spectrum where monogenic disorders are generally more severe and often include skeletal deformities and extra-skeletal abnormalities. Multifactorial FBD, on the other hand, usually present with milder symptoms that are often restricted to bone fragility. Osteoporosis is a common skeletal disease characterized by low bone mass, low bone mineral density (BMD) and increased fracture risk (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kanis et al., 1994</a>). It affects about 200 million people around the world (<a href=\"#bib34\">Pouresmaeili et al., 2018</a>). In Europe, 5.6% of the population aged over 50 is diagnosed with osteoporosis, making it a highly prevalent disease, especially in the elderly. The risk of osteoporosis is influenced by both environmental factors, such as physical activity, diet preferences, medication use, coexisting diseases, and genetic factors (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ralston and Uitterlinden, 2010</a>). Low BMD and fractures are highly heritable risk factors, with heritability values ranging from 50% to 80% (<a href=\"#bib36\">Richards et al., 2012</a>). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in humans have unraveled hundreds of susceptible loci associated with BMD and other bone traits related to risk of osteoporotic fracture (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zhu et al., 2021</a>). GWAS results have great potential for the development of drug targets, the identification of risk factors, and risk prediction for osteoporosis. However, the identification of causal genes at these loci or the mechanisms by which GWAS loci alter bone physiology has faced challenges due to the scarcity of <i>in vivo</i> validation tools with sufficient throughput (<a href=\"#bib38\">Sabik and Farber, 2017</a>).",

One example of such a disease is osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a genetically heterogeneous connective tissue disorder that is mainly characterized by bone fragility, skeletal deformities, and other extra skeletal manifestations (<a href=\"#bib14\">Forlino and Marini, 2016</a>). Although in the majority of cases, it is caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the collagen type 1 genes, mutations in an increasing number of non-collagen genes causing severe recessive forms of OI, are being identified. These genes encode proteins that are involved in different aspects of bone formation, such as osteoblast differentiation (OSTERIX, WNT1, OASIS, S2P, and SPARC), bone mineralization (PEDF and BRIL) and collagen processing (HSP47, FKBP65, LH2, KDELR2, CRTAP, P3H1, CyPB, and TRIC-B) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Forlino and Marini, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Jovanovic et al., 2022</a>). Recent sequencing technologies have improved genetic diagnosis, but the investigation of the pathogenesis of the different forms of OI is still a laborious, costly, and time-consuming task. Hence, it is essential to develop efficient and cost-effective methods for <i>in vivo</i> functional testing to validate the involvement and mechanistic role of candidate and newly identified causal genes in the pathogenesis of FBD.",

More than 70% of human protein-coding genes and 82% of human disease-related genes have zebrafish orthologs, including most of the genes involved in skeletogenesis (<a href=\"#bib17\">Howe et al., 2013</a>). Additionally, zebrafish share many of their skeletal features and ossification mechanisms with mammals (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dietrich et al., 2021</a>) and numerous zebrafish models for skeletal diseases have been established and investigated (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gistelinck et al., 2018</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Daponte et al., 2023</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kague and Karasik, 2022</a>). These models have some advantages over rodent models, such as longer survival, likely due to the reduced impact of gravity on their fragile skeletons in the aquatic environment, and the availability of transgenic lines marking specific bone cell types combined with the transparency of early life stages allowing for <i>in vivo</i> observation of the dynamics of skeletal development (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dietrich et al., 2021</a>).",

However, obtaining zebrafish lines that are homozygous for the mutant alleles requires two generations of adult animals (&gt;6 months), which limits the efficiency and affordability of genetic screens (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kroll et al., 2021</a>). To overcome these drawbacks, phenotyping the first-generation (F0) mosaic founder zebrafish, also known as crispants, is an emerging approach. Adult crispants have a shorter generation time (~3 months) than stable lines (6–9 months), which allows screening more genes in less time and at lower costs and resources. We previously demonstrated the feasibility of this approach by comparing the phenotypes and molecular profiles of a stable knockout line and a crispant for the osteoporosis gene <i>lrp5</i>, and found them to be highly similar (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bek et al., 2020</a>). In a study by <a href=\"#bib49\">Watson et al., 2020</a>, comparison of crispants to homozygous germline mutants for <i>bmp1a</i> and <i>plod2</i>, two causal OI genes, revealed phenotypic convergence, suggesting that crispants faithfully recapitulate the biology of germline skeletal disease models. Therefore, while zebrafish crispant screens are promising as an economic, fast, and biologically relevant genetic screening approach in vertebrate model systems, a rigorous evaluation of their potential to screen for FBD-associated genes is needed.",

To quantify the extent of differences between crispants and their controls, the means of these parameters in the crispants’ vertebral column, were normalized to the standard deviation of the controls, resulting in a z-score [z-score = (mean crispant – mean control) / SD control] (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gistelinck et al., 2018</a>). A significant increase in centrum volume was observed in <i>daam2</i> crispants compared to the controls (p&lt;0.05, z=2.86; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a>). Centrum TMD was significantly higher, and to a similar extent, in crispants for <i>daam2</i> (p&lt;0.05; z=1.54), <i>esr1</i> (p&lt;0.05; z=1.62), and <i>sost</i> (p&lt;0.05; z=1.41), three genes likely involved in osteoporosis pathogenesis.

In this study, we tested the efficacy of a semi-high throughput zebrafish crispant analysis for rapid validation of candidate disease causing genes for skeletal disorders across a broad phenotypic spectrum. On one hand, we included genes for non-classical recessive OI, which is an early-onset monogenic skeletal syndrome with severe skeletal deformities. On the other hand, we screened a set of top candidate genes for osteoporosis, which is a rather late-onset multifactorial disease with little to no deformities. All selected genes show skeletal expression in both human and zebrafish. An overview of the selected genes with observed mutant phenotypes in human, mice and zebrafish is provided in <a href=\"#supp1\">Supplementary file 1a</a>. It is important to note that this study focused on candidate genes for osteoporosis, not on the role of specific variants identified in GWAS studies. Non-coding variants for instance, which are often identified in GWAS studies, present significant challenges in terms of functional validation and interpretation. In this study we propose a crispant screening platform that combines various phenotypic and molecular assays at three key developmental and adult stages (7, 14 and 90 dpf).

Interestingly, <a href=\"#bib3\">Brett et al., 2021</a> extensively investigated <i>esr1</i> mutations in the context of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer but did not evaluate the presence of osteoblasts.

These findings aligned with the observed malformations in <i>bulldog</i> zebrafish, where disrupted <i>sec24d</i> function leads to head abnormalities and growth delays in early larval stages (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sarmah et al., 2010</a>).

Specifically, the expression of <i>bglap</i>, a late osteoblast differentiation marker appeared to be consistently downregulated in near all crispants, except for crispants for <i>sost</i>, <i>mbtps2,</i> and <i>sparc</i> at 7 dpf. However, this downregulation became less pronounced at 14 dpf, affecting only crispants for <i>aldh7a1, daam2, esr1,</i> and <i>creb3l1</i>. Interestingly, most crispants for genes involved in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis exhibited this downregulation, except for <i>sost</i>, where the expression of <i>bglap</i> remained unaffected. In contrast, the expression of <i>col1a1a</i> showed an opposing trend. Initially, a modest upregulation of this marker was observed at 7 dpf, limited to just four crispants. However, this effect intensified over time, with nearly all crispants displaying upregulation at 14 dpf, except for <i>aldh7a1</i>, <i>esr1</i>, and <i>sparc</i>. The remarkable upregulation of <i>col1a1</i> expression could potentially arise from an abundance of immature osteoblasts within the cranial skeleton, a phenomenon we frequently observed across the set of crispants (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amarasekara et al., 2021</a>). These osteoblasts play an active role in the synthesis of the organic bone matrix, including the production of collagen type I fibers. Interestingly, the generally diminished expression of the late osteoblastic marker <i>bglap</i> corroborates the presence of less mature osteoblasts (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gavaia et al., 2006</a>). As mainly mature osteoblasts engage in the deposition of calcium and phosphate ions, essential for the formation of hydroxyapatite crystals, bone mineralization can be expected to be reduced in the crispants, which results in increased formation of non-mineralized osteoid deposits. Indeed, we observed that despite often increased bone osteoblast-positive surfaces, mineralization-positive areas in the head skeleton were frequently found to be reduced (<a href=\"#bib39\">Salhotra et al., 2020</a>). The differential expression profiles of the osteogenic markers <i>bglap</i> and <i>col1a1a</i> highlight their potential as biomarkers for osteoblast differentiation and bone formation in FBD crispant screens. However, it is important to note that the genes evaluated by RT-PCR are not exclusively expressed in bone tissue. Since whole-body samples were used for expression analysis, there is a possibility that the observed changes in gene expression may be influenced by other non-skeletal cell types.",

Phenotypic variability in these zebrafish larvae can be attributed to several factors, including crispant mosaicism, allele heterogeneity, environmental factors, differences in genomic background and development, maternally-deposited RNAs, and slightly variable imaging positioning. In our study, for each crispant and corresponding controls, all experiments at different ages were conducted on zebrafish from the same clutch, allowing analysis of a developmental time series in animals with a relative genetically homogeneous background. Although increasing the number of biological replicates could potentially enhance statistical power, previous studies have not confirmed this (<a href=\"#bib51\">Winter et al., 2022</a>). Enhancing out-of frame (OOF) rates by simultaneously targeting a single gene with multiple crRNAs could potentially increase the penetrance of phenotypic abnormalities observed in early crispants. By directing crRNAs to multiple loci within one gene, the likelihood of introducing frameshift mutations increases significantly. This is suggested to lead to a higher rate of biallelic knockout and reduce the chances of retaining the functional protein (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kroll et al., 2021</a>). However, this also elevates the likelihood of off-target effects, increases double-strand breaks and toxicity, while simultaneously increasing costs (<a href=\"#bib52\">Wu et al., 2018</a>). Furthermore, also in-frame indels affecting two or more amino acids, detected in a substantial proportion of NGS reads in our study, are likely to have a detrimental effect on protein function (<a href=\"#bib12\">Emond et al., 2020</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Savino et al., 2022</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Miton and Tokuriki, 2023</a>). Therefore, and because we used highly efficient two-part guide RNAs Alt-R CRISPR-Cas9 system, we opted for single crRNA injections. While there remains a possibility of false negatives, the overall indel efficiency, as indicated by our NGS analysis, is high (&gt;90%), thereby reducing the likelihood of having crispants with very low indel efficiency.",

However, our results challenged this notion, by showing that in crispants for osteoporosis genes, skeletal abnormalities can manifest earlier and are not solely reflected in changes to bone mineral density (BMD). For instance, we found that <i>aldh7a1</i> and <i>esr1</i> crispants displayed significant skeletal anomalies already at larval stages, with <i>aldh7a1</i> crispants showing early lethality. At adult stages, <i>esr1</i> and <i>sost</i> crispants demonstrated various morphological abnormalities of the vertebral column such as fusions, compressions, and arch malformations. The more pronounced and earlier phenotypes in these zebrafish crispants are most likely attributed to the quasi knock-out state of the studied genes, while more common less impactful variants in the same genes result in typical late-onset osteoporosis (<a href=\"#bib25\">Laine et al., 2013</a>). This phenomenon is also observed in knock-out mouse models for these genes (<a href=\"#bib30\">Melville et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Coughlin et al., 2019</a>).",

                            "text": "Interestingly, all adult crispants for osteoporosis genes demonstrated a substantial increase in centrum Tissue Mineral Density (TMD). TMD is quantitative measure of the actual mineral volume within bone tissue, computed as bone mineral content over the bone volume (mgHA/cm3) and obtained through mCT or pQCT. In human patients, reduced bone mineral density (aBMD), a measure for the bone mineral content in a projected bone area and assessed using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), is frequently linked to osteoporosis. However, also TMD, or vBMD, can be evaluated in the trabecular and cortical bone. Knock-out mice lacking Sost showed an increase in TMD within the cortical bone, which is comparable to the bone present in the zebrafish vertebral column (<a href=\"#bib27\">Li et al., 2008</a>). As for the other genes, for <i>daam2</i>, mutant mice with a hypomorphic <i>Daam2</i> allele presented with reduced bone strength and increased cortical bone porosity (<a href=\"#bib32\">Morris et al., 2019</a>). <i>ERα</i> knockout mice presented with a decrease in cortical bone mineral density and increase in trabecular bone mineral density (<a href=\"#bib30\">Melville et al., 2014</a>). Further studies are needed to better understand how high TMD values observed in these crispants relate to phenotypic changes observed in these mouse models. Finally, it is worthwhile to note that, osteoporosis typically correlates with low vBMD values. While neither the causal variant nor the biological direction of its effects on the target gene are known for BMD-associated loci harboring these genes, the increased TMD following gene knockdown in our models may help to assign the directionality of their effects, and puts forth the possibility that variants at these loci alter the expression of genes that converge on a common biological process in zebrafish, when disrupted results in the high TMD.",

Interestingly, during these early stages, the majority of the crispants do not exhibit consistent skeletal abnormalities.

Genetic compensation ensures an organism to maintain its genetic robustness, even when genetic variation, possibly induced by mutations, occurs. This compensation mechanism can be triggered by the upregulation of compensating genes, often mediated through the regulation of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) in combination with the epigenetic machinery in zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib11\">El-Brolosy and Stainier, 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Jakutis and Stainier, 2021</a>). Crispants, in contrast to morphants, also undergo NMD although in a mosaic manner. In larval crispants, compensatory mechanisms may effectively mask the impact of gene loss. However, in adult crispants, the cumulative effect of this loss becomes more pronounced, leading to a later onset phenotype. Furthermore, specific tissues or cell types within the organism may activate compensatory pathways more efficiently, thereby influencing the overall manifestation of the phenotype. When a gene is disrupted in humans, the consequences can be more severe due to the complexity of human development and biology. Such disruptions may result in developmental abnormalities, leading to an early onset of phenotypic traits (<a href=\"#bib37\">Rouf et al., 2023</a>).",

While this work represents a pioneering effort in establishing a screening platform for skeletal diseases, it offers opportunities for future improvement and refinement. For instance, analyzing different skeletal structures and cell types within various transgenic lines, increasing sample size, and incorporating a broader range of techniques, such as phenotypic scoring based on the type of malformations seen in the vertebral column or alcian blue staining for cartilage tissue evaluation, could enhance the comprehensiveness of the screening process and the skeletal phenotype. Moreover, to explore the underlying mechanisms contributing to disease phenotypes, it is essential to establish stable knockout mutants derived from the crispants. Nonetheless, our initial set-up demonstrates the feasibility of this approach to identify genes potentially implicated in the pathogenesis of skeletal disorders, as all studied crispants exhibit skeletal abnormalities in adult stages. These findings support the prospect of crispant screening as a promising tool for rapid functional assessment of candidate genes for skeletal disorders, providing valuable insights into the roles of these genes in skeletal biology.",

The design of the guide RNAs is convincingly described, while the effectiveness of the method is evaluated to 60% to 92% of the respective target genes being presumably inactivated. Thus, injected F0 larvae can be directly used to investigate the consequences of this inactivation.",
