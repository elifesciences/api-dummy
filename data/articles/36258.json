Using a combination of biophysical methods, structural analysis by NMR and electron microscopy, and cellular transcription assays, we developed a model that proposes a concerted role of intrinsic disorder and multiple LC8 binding events in regulating LC8 transcription. We demonstrate that the long intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain of ASCIZ binds LC8 to form a dynamic ensemble of complexes with a gradient of transcriptional activity that is inversely proportional to LC8 occupancy. The preference for low occupancy complexes at saturating LC8 concentrations with both human and <i>Drosophila</i> ASCIZ indicates that negative cooperativity is an important feature of ASCIZ-LC8 interactions. The prevalence of intrinsic disorder and multivalency among transcription factors suggests that formation of heterogeneous, dynamic complexes is a widespread mechanism for tuning transcriptional regulation.",

Using a combination of biophysical methods, structural analysis by NMR and electron microscopy, and cellular transcription assays, we developed a model that proposes a concerted role of intrinsic disorder and multiple LC8 binding events in regulating LC8 transcription. We demonstrate that the long intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain of ASCIZ binds LC8 to form a dynamic ensemble of complexes with a gradient of transcriptional activity that is inversely proportional to LC8 occupancy. The preference for low occupancy complexes at saturating LC8 concentrations with both human and <i>Drosophila</i> ASCIZ indicates that negative cooperativity is an important feature of ASCIZ-LC8 interactions. The prevalence of intrinsic disorder and multivalency among transcription factors suggests that formation of heterogeneous, dynamic complexes is a widespread mechanism for tuning transcriptional regulation.",

As the number of LC8 molecules bound to ASCIZ increased, the rate of transcription dropped. However, all of the binding sites were rarely fully occupied. Instead, three to four attached LC8 molecules seemed to be sufficient to ensure that LC8 levels remain balanced. When the number of LC8 molecules exceeded this value, the attachment rate for additional LC8 slowed down. So, even when there was an excess of LC8, most of the human ASCIZ binding sites were only partially filled. This way, the production of LC8 proteins was slowed, rather than fully shut down. As a result, the cells were able to fine-tune the transcription rate of LC8 and maintain a stable and balanced pool of these proteins.",

LC8 preferentially binds to a 10-amino acid motif in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) containing highly conserved TQT residues at positions 7–9 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Barbar, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Rapali et al., 2011b</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>).

Analysis of the 11 crystal structures of LC8 bound to short peptides containing the motif explains why the TQT residues are essential for binding: the Q is involved in interactions with both LC8 subunits in the dimer, while both T’s are fully buried and thus evolutionarily constrained. In these interactions, TQT acts as the motif anchor while the other seven highly variable motif residues modulate affinity, as described in the <i>anchored flexibility model</i> of LC8 motif recognition (<a href=\"#bib12\">Clark et al., 2016</a>). LC8 binds one motif in each of its two symmetrical binding grooves (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>), creating an IDP duplex that serves as a bivalent scaffold. This scaffold aids in higher order complex assembly by promoting binding of other proteins, including additional LC8 dimers (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>), and enhancing self-association and oligomerization processes that often involve coiled-coil formation (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hall et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kidane et al., 2013</a>). In recent years, the number of experimentally characterized LC8 partners has risen to more than 40, and prediction methods indicate that dozens more may specifically bind LC8 (<a href=\"#bib57\">Rapali et al., 2011b</a>).

The CD spectrum of dZnF shows a large negative ellipticity at 208 nm and a small negative ellipticity at 222 nm (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>, red) indicative of a mix of alpha helices and loops, similar to CD spectra of other ZnF proteins (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ezomo et al., 2010</a>). The dLBD CD spectrum has a large negative ellipticity at 200 nm, indicating that it is primarily disordered (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>, blue). From 5D NMR experiments, backbone assignments for 90% of the 148 residues in dLBD were obtained (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>). A high level of disorder in dLBD is revealed by the limited amide proton chemical shift dispersion in <sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>), and a lack of secondary structure preference is further supported by small ΔCα-ΔCβ chemical shift differences from random coil values (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>). Together these data demonstrate that dASCIZ contains an N-terminal structured domain as well as a long intrinsically disordered domain, and constructs of each domain are monomeric in solution.",

Interestingly, construct QT4-6, containing recognition sites 4–6, binds LC8 with a K<sub>d</sub> of 1.0 μM, a slightly higher overall affinity than the full dLBD construct. QT4-7, on the other hand, binds LC8 with a 1.6 μM affinity and is slightly more entropically disfavored than either QT4-6 or dLBD (<a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>). The overall K<sub>d</sub> values of QT1-3, QT2-4, and QT4-7, are 2.4 μM, 4.1 μM, and 1.6 μM, respectively.",

The K<sub>d</sub> values for all peptides indicate surprisingly weak affinity. QT3p interaction with LC8 is not even detected at 30 μM LC8. Intriguingly, the QT4-6 construct has a slightly higher binding affinity than the other constructs, while the QT4, QT5, and QT6 peptides display among the lowest affinity as individual peptides.

The dLBD was titrated with increasing concentrations of LC8 and complex formation was assessed at dLBD:LC8 molar ratios 1:1, 1:3, 1:6, and 1:10. Plots of the continuous size distribution, c(S), vs. sedimentation coefficient (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>) show that titration at sub-saturating concentrations of LC8 results in a broad peak that is likely an equilibrium mixture of complexes with varying LC8 occupancy in exchange with each other and with free dLBD. At a saturating concentration of LC8 (1:10 ratio), a high occupancy complex whose size (7.5 s) approximately corresponds to a fully bound complex (197 kDa) is clearly evident. Contrary to expectations, a low stoichiometry complex (5 s, approx. 114 kDa) is even more highly populated. A high frictional ratio (<i>f</i>/<i>f<sub>0</sub></i> ~ 1.6) indicates an elongated complex, and the molecular weight of this low occupancy complex corresponds roughly to a 1:3 complex, although its broadness, and the approximate nature of the molecular weight determination, indicate that multiple species are present. It is likely that the low occupancy peak, which is roughly twice the intensity of the high occupancy peak, is a heterogeneous mixture of 1:2, 1:3 and 1:4 complexes.",

As the molar ratio is increased, the diffuse upper band becomes a dark smear, free LC8 accumulates in a pronounced dark band, and the free dLBD band disappears. We think the most likely explanation is that the decreasing mobility of the upper edge of the smear indicates increasing sizes of the complexes formed.

Very similar behavior is observed for hLBD, although the gel mobility of hLBD bands is much lower than the mobility of dLBD bands due to molecular sieving of the much larger hLBD (53 kDa) compared to dLBD (17 kDa). Molecular sieving is the dominate effect on hLBD mobility as both hLBD and dLBD are disordered and highly extended and have a pI of ~4. As LC8 is added to hLBD, the free hLBD band disappears and a lower mobility smear becomes increasingly evident. Decreasing mobility of the upper smear indicates increasing sizes of the complexes formed, while the appearance of a bands migrating the same as free LC8 at ratios ≥ 1:4 indicates the presence of a pool of free LC8 well below LC8 saturation of hLBD. Together the gel titration data for dLBD and hLBD suggest that hLBD:LC8 complexes form a dynamic ensemble with varying levels of LC8 occupancy in which lower occupancy forms are favored.",

Both LMW and HMW complexes form at the first titration point and increase in population as more LC8 is added. A low occupancy intermediate, labeled LMW, is clearly evident at the lowest molar ratio of 1:3, and persists at the same elution volume even at the highest molar ratios. Higher occupancy species, HMW, are also apparent at a ratio of 1:3 and become increasingly distinct as LC8 is increased. The peak corresponding to excess LC8 is discernable at a ratio of 1:7, and steadily increases as LC8 is added. Taken together, the data in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> are consistent with the explanation that a low occupancy form of the hLBD:LC8 complex is favored even with a large excess of LC8. A minor population of high occupancy complexes, present even at the lowest molar ratio, increases with increasing LC8 and is in equilibrium with the LMW species and with free LC8, and therefore with each other.

Density corresponding to the IDP duplex chain cannot be resolved by negative stain EM, therefore complexes formed with a single LC8 dimer were not included in this analysis, as they could not be distinguished from unbound LC8 dimers.",

Although uncommon, high-occupancy and fully-formed complexes of dLBD:LC8 (1:7 ratio) could be identified from the raw single particle images (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</a>), further confirming the stoichiometry obtained by our ITC studies. For the hLBD:LC8 dataset, complexes containing as many as 7–9 LC8 dimers could be distinguished from the single particle image data, while higher-order complexes containing 10–11 LC8 dimers were either not distinguishable or were simply absent under the limiting concentrations required for negative stain EM specimen preparation. Nevertheless, the remarkable similarity in distribution of oligomeric species formed by dLBD and hLBD, obtained under similar binding conditions, is consistent with the nearly equivalent overall LC8 affinity determined by ITC, and suggests that a conserved mechanism of negative cooperativity is used by ASCIZ to regulate the formation and distribution of higher-order LC8 assemblies.",

Notably, the linear assembly pattern of LC8 dimers observed by negative stain EM suggests an ordered (or quasi-ordered) sequence of assembly, apparently favoring neighboring TQT sites. However, the location of LC8 binding sites could not be resolved in these experiments. Therefore, to examine interactions between individual motifs and LC8 in the context of the full dLBD, we turned to NMR. As unlabeled LC8 is titrated into solutions of <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>13</sup>C- labeled dLBD, changes in NH peak intensities can be measured in 3D HNCO spectra recorded for dLBD:LC8 molar ratios of 1:0.25, 1:1, 1:2, 1:5, 1:8. As LC8 concentration increases, a corresponding decrease in dLBD peak intensity is observed (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>). At a molar ratio of 1:5, less than 10% of the original peak intensity remains at all seven LC8 binding sites. At a ratio of 1:8, all dLBD peaks completely disappear except for peaks corresponding to eight N-terminal residues (241-248), indicating that all TQT sites have been occupied to some degree. The absence of peaks for bound dLBD is attributed to line broadening associated with intermediate exchange processes and/or faster transverse relaxation as a result of increased complex size. Therefore, we consider a decrease in peak intensity as a measure of increased complex formation.",

QT2-4 was chosen to further validate LC8 binding to the QT3 motif that as an individual peptide showed weak binding by ITC, and QT4-6 was chosen because it has the highest LC8 binding affinity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). Further, the two constructs share the QT4 motif, allowing us to assess its affinity in two sequence contexts. Due to the smaller number of peaks for shorter constructs, HSQC spectra have a sufficiently high resolution to render an HNCO-based titration unnecessary. Unlabeled LC8 was titrated into <sup>15</sup>N-labeled QT2-4 or QT4-6 and changes in peak intensity were analyzed (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b,c</a>). As with dLBD, there is a gradual decrease in peak intensity as more LC8 is added to QT2-4 or to QT4-6 at molar ratios: 1:0.25, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4. Significantly, peak intensities in QT4-6 decrease at lower LC8 ratio than in QT2-4, confirming the trend we observe in full-length dLBD.

Empty vector and the ΔZnF construct showed limited transcriptional activity compared to ASCIZ constructs. Most significantly, transcriptional activity of the AAA mutants can be ranked to form an activity gradient (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7c</a>) notable for a clear inverse relationship between their transcriptional activity and their affinity for LC8. While the differences between each construct are very small, the overall trend supports the hypothesis that affinity and transcriptional activity are correlated.

Here we integrate multiple approaches to elucidate the structure, dynamics, thermodynamics, and hydrodynamics of the large disordered ASCIZ-LC8 complexes, that together reveal a new model by which ASCIZ can maintain stable pools of the hub protein LC8. We tested the main features of this model in cells using transcription activity assays which show a trend wherein mutant ASCIZ constructs with lower LC8 occupancy display higher transcriptional activity, while constructs with higher LC8 occupancy have lower activity. We propose that a dynamic ensemble of complexes is important for fine-tuning ASCIZ transcriptional activity, where stable, low occupancy complexes function to maintain a basal buffering transcription rate for LC8. A change in LC8 cellular concentration would shift this dynamic equilibrium to a higher or lower occupancy state without dramatically altering the level of transcription. As LC8 is an essential regulator of dozens of cellular processes, an ability to maintain an LC8 ‘buffer’ is likely important for cellular homeostasis. Although many other transcription factors are regulated by multisite phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Holmberg et al., 2002</a>) or multiple binding events to different proteins (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cantor and Orkin, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Reményi et al., 2004</a>), we find no examples of activity tuned by multivalent binding to the gene product in a negative autoregulatory role, which underscores the novelty and potential impact of this study.",

Human ASCIZ contains an intrinsically disordered domain that is 600 amino acids long, or 73% of its overall sequence. The well-studied transcription factor p53, by contrast, is 40% disordered and the disordered regions are dispersed through three different regions of the protein rather than being concentrated on one terminus (<a href=\"#bib35\">Laptenko et al., 2016</a>). Intrinsically disordered regions longer than 50 amino acids are considered to be of significant size for eukaryotic transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib41\">Liu et al., 2006</a>). As intrinsic disorder is proposed to play an important role in regulating function (<a href=\"#bib61\">Shammas, 2017</a>), it is possible that the length of the disordered domain enables a larger diversity of functions. Indeed, recent work has shown that the length of the intrinsically disordered domain can control transcriptional activity through ‘energetic frustration’, wherein opposing energetic couplings mediate the overall activity (<a href=\"#bib38\">Li et al., 2017</a>).",

Nup159 cooperatively binds five LC8 dimers and forms a relatively stable complex readily visible by electron microscopy and 2D classification analysis (<a href=\"#bib62\">Stelter et al., 2007</a>). As Nup159 has a slightly lower affinity for LC8 than ASCIZ (2.9 μM vs. 0.9 μM, respectively (<a href=\"#bib49\">Nyarko et al., 2013</a>), the difference between the Nup159 grids with uniformly stacked structures and the ASCIZ grids with sparse and heterogeneous structures of 2–4 stacked LC8 dimers is intriguing. This difference in structural heterogeneity can be attributed to the higher flexibility or short life time of ASCIZ:LC8 complexes relative to Nup159:LC8 complexes, while the scarcity of high-occupancy states is consistent with a unique mode of negative cooperativity. Given the different function of Nup159 (in nuclear pore assembly) versus ASCIZ:LC8 complexes (transcription regulation), the data suggest that the dynamic properties and unique mechanism of assembly that is conserved in LC8-ASCIZ complexes may reflect an important feature required for autoregulation of LC8 transcription.",

Similarly, the function of p53 is modulated by over 50 posttranslational modifications that are proposed to be interdependent (<a href=\"#bib44\">Meek and Anderson, 2009</a>).

While many other transcription factors tune their activity through multisite regulation, we could find no other examples besides ASCIZ where binding to multiple copies of their gene product modulates activity; yet, the prevalence of IDP domains in transcription factors indicates that such mechanisms are likely to be widespread and studies such as these are becoming more tractable with the integrated approaches used here.",

The ASCIZ-LC8 complex primarily exists as a dynamic equilibrium of different complex stoichiometries and degrees of disorder (center brackets). We propose that this low occupancy conformational ensemble is important for maintaining a basal level of LC8 transcription. It acts as a buffer for changes in the concentration of LC8 and fine-tunes transcription levels according to cellular needs. A change in LC8 cellular concentration would shift this dynamic equilibrium to a higher or lower occupancy state without dramatically altering the level of transcription. All 11 (or 7) binding sites are therefore occupied in the heterogeneous mixture of complexes, as is demonstrated by NMR titration (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), and participate in maintaining a homeostatic concentration of LC8. Thus, it is ensured that a high concentration of LC8 does not drastically decrease LC8 production, but rather shifts it to a lower level. As LC8 is a hub protein that interacts with &gt;40 protein partners, and is predicted to bind to 100 additional proteins from a diverse selection of cellular pathways (<a href=\"#bib57\">Rapali et al., 2011b</a>), maintaining a constant level of its transcription is essential.",

Shorter constructs of the dLBD were generated by cloning residues 241–324 (QT1-3), 271–341 (QT2-4), 299–376 (QT4-6), and 321–388 (QT4-7) into the pET2Zt2-1a vector. The human LC8 binding domain (hLBD) construct was generated by cloning human ASCIZ (Uniprot O43313) residues 362–823 into the pET24d vector (Novagen) and expressing the construct in frame with a hexahistidine tag and TEV cleavage site.",

Mutations were performed using either the QuikChange Lightening Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent) or by synthesizing short constructs (300–350 bp) containing the desired mutations and using Gibson Assembly (New England Biosciences, Ipswich) to insert them into the LC8-binding domain (hLBD) gene (residues 362–823 of human ASCIZ).

Recombinant protein expression was induced with 0.4 mM IPTG (for LB cultures) and growth continued at 25°C for 16 hr. Cells were harvested and purified under denaturing conditions using TALON His-Tag Purification protocol (Clontech). The solubility tag and/or hexahistidine tag were cleaved by TEV protease and the protein was further purified using strong anion exchange chromatography (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California) followed by gel filtration on a Superdex<sup>TM</sup> 75 gel filtration column (GE Health).

Digital micrographs were recorded on a 2K × 2K CCD camera (FEI Eagle) with a calibrated pixel size of 4.37 Å pixel<sup>−1</sup> and a defocus of 2.0–3.5 μm. For the dLBD-LC8 specimen, a total of 2574 single particle images were extracted from ~300 micrographs, and for hLBD-LC8, 1234 particles were extracted from ~200 micrographs. Complexes with clear oligomeric structure could be identified and were manually-selected using EMAN2 (<a href=\"#bib65\">Tang et al., 2007</a>). Single particle images were extracted with a box size of 160 × 160 pixels and CTF-corrected (phase-flipped) in EMAN2. Reference-free 2D class averages were generated in EMAN2 and RELION 2.0 (<a href=\"#bib59\">Scheres, 2012</a>) using CTF-corrected and high-pass filtered image datasets. Statistical analysis of oligomeric composition was performed by counting the number of subunits identified from single particle images and classifying them manually as 2 – 7mers (dLBD:LC8 complexes) or 2 – 11mers (hLBD:LC8 complexes) (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</a>). Particles that could not be confidently assigned were discarded, leaving 2334 oligomers assigned for the dLBD:LC8 and 967 for hLBD:LC8 datasets. Complexes containing only a single LC8 dimer could not be distinguished from unbound LC8 particles, and were not included in our analysis.",

Approximately 2 kbp of the Dynll1 promoter was cloned into the pGL3 vector (Promega, Madison, WI) upstream of the firefly luciferase gene as previously described (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jurado et al., 2012a</a>). Using FuGENE 6 (Promega), immortalized ASCIZ knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jurado et al., 2010</a>) were co-transfected with ASCIZ constructs, the Dynll1 promoter, and a pRL-CMV vector containing <i>Renilla</i> luciferase for normalization of firefly/luciferase ratios. The authenticity of the ASCIZ knockout MEF cell line was verified by PCR genotyping of the ASCIZ locus. The cell line tested to be free from mycoplasma contamination using a MycoAlert mycoplasma detection kit (Lonza, Switzerland). 24 hr after transfection, cells were transferred to 96-well plates and incubated overnight before determining reporter gene activities using the dual-luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega) and a Polarstar Optima (BMG Labtechnologies, Germany) instrument. For assessment of protein expression levels, human U2OS cells were transfected with ASCIZ constructs using FuGENE six and were probed with ASCIZ antibody (<a href=\"#bib43\">McNees et al., 2005</a>).",

Can the authors look at say smaller constructs that contain only 3 or only the 4 dimer sites in an effort to circumvent the issue with disappearing peaks?

Others have reported that ASCIZ regulates the expression of LC8 in certain cell types, and in some cancer cell lines, and that disruption of this regulatory circuit is associated with mitotic defects seen previously with loss of LC8. In addition, others have reported that the CTR of ASCIZ contains multiple short linear motifs (SLIMs) with the sequence TQT known to bind to LC8. Here, the authors characterized seven LC8 binding SLIMs within the CTR of <i>Drosophila</i> ASCIZ using ITC, AUC, and NMR. As LC8 was titrated into the ASCIZ CTR, a mixture of sub-stoichiometric and 1:7 complexes were formed, presumably with two CTRs stitched together by multiple LC8 dimers (as proposed by the authors). Mutagenesis of several different combinations of multiple SLIMs confirmed their LC8 binding properties and allowed the rank order of their μM affinities to be determined. The authors noted that the affinity of the CTR, with multiple binding sites, for LC8 was higher than that of isolated binding site, but this point was not rigorously addressed in the manuscript. The authors extended their studies to the CTR of human ASCIZ, which they showed contains 11 LC8 binding SLIMs using ITC and mutagenesis. Finally, the authors performed a Luc-reporter transcription assay using wt and mutant ASCIZ expressed in ASCIZ null MEFs, which showed that mutation of LC8 binding SLIMs was associated with a slight increase in expression of the luc reporter. This latter finding suggests that LC8 exerts negative feedback on its expression by binding to the SLIMs within the CTR of ASCIZ, possibly altering DNA binding and/or interactions with other transcription factors. While the authors' hypothesis regarding this negative feedback mechanism is novel and interesting, the data in the manuscript fall well short of proving the hypothesis. Much more extensive in vitro and in cell data would be needed to establish the LC8 concentration dependence of the negative feedback circuit and further data required to elucidate the associated mechanism of feedback. In addition, the new knowledge gained regarding the identification of LC8 binding SLIMs within fly and human ASCIZ seems incremental with respect to the 2011 BBRC report from Rapali, et al. Therefore, the manuscript does not provide the level of rigor, novelty and impact associated with <i>eLife</i> but rather would be more suitable for a more technical journal.",

In addition to the caveats mentioned by the authors, there is a strong possibility of intramolecular interactions leading to a lower intensity in the free LBD with binding to LC8 disrupting these intramolecular interactions and leading to increase of intensity for some LBD regions. This should be acknowledged and is especially important given the suggestion of \"slightly more ordered structure in its C-terminal half\" of the LBD. (Note that \"ordered\" would be better described as \"transient\", given the overall disordered nature of the LBD.) The differing apparent correlation times for LBD residues depending on distances from direct LC8 binding site(s) on the LBD and from the termini should also be acknowledged (P Wright and J Dyson). The complexity of interpretation of intensities needs to be laid out even if trying to make a simple interpretation. Ultimately, this reviewer is not convinced of the validity of the \"two sub-domains\" identified based on these different Kd and cooperativity values, due to the lack of ability to quantify local affinities from the NMR intensities.",

All three reviewers felt that this is a fascinating system and that the work does help in understanding of how regulation does occur. Yet there were some reservations about the novelty, with significantly more experiments required at the in-vitro and cellular level to prove the hypothesis regarding the feedback mechanism regulating expression. In addition, it was felt that the work would be strengthened by additional NMR experiments to more fully characterize the binding. Thus, although all reviewers felt that the work was of interest, all noted weaknesses that prohibit publication in eLife.",

Yet there was some reservation about publication in <i>eLife</i> in its current form and reviewers suggested several ways to strengthen the work. In this revision we address all the reviewers concerns and add substantial amount of data that considerably strengthen our model. Briefly, the new data include negative stain electron microscopy that give a structural view and quantitative distribution of the multiple disordered complexes in dynamic equilibrium (Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Negative stain electron microscopy is particularly challenging for disordered systems and therefore the work here pushes the limit of this technique. New data for characterizing the dynamic intermediate were also obtained using small angle X-ray scattering and gel filtration (Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1). We have collected significantly more NMR data (Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1) and changed the Introduction (Figure 1) and interpretation of the model (Figure 8). As a result, this manuscript is much more focused and we hope is now suitable for publication in <i>eLife</i>. Below we briefly address the reviewers’ major concerns.",

The major insight by NMR is that there are two different classes of binding regions that bind either 3 or 4 LC8 dimers with different affinities.

Can the authors look at say smaller constructs that contain only 3 or only the 4 dimer sites in an effort to circumvent the issue with disappearing peaks? Indeed even smaller constructs would allow to address whether at low stoichiometries there is preferential binding to one of the sites, whether there is exchange between sites and what both the kinetics and thermodynamics might be.",

The low occupancy complexes are favored, relative to higher occupancy complexes, even in samples having a large excess of LC8. The presence of stable, low occupancy complexes is supported by new small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data, negative stain electron microscopy, and gel filtration. Importantly, also new to this submission, we show a similar behavior for human ASCIZ, and discuss that negative cooperativity in the transition from low occupancy to high occupancy complexes is a conserved feature of ASCIZ-LC8 interactions and explains the higher population of the low occupancy complexes. The completely revised discussion speculates on the biological ramifications of the ability of ASCIZ to undergo both positive and negative cooperativity.",

Using a combination of methods that include SAXS, AUC, gel filtration, native gel, and negative stain electron microscopy, we demonstrate that both the human and <i>Drosophila</i> proteins form a dynamic complex with LC8.

For example, an increase in LC8 cellular concentration would cause a small shift in the complex equilibrium towards a higher occupancy state and a corresponding decrease in the level of transcription, instead of causing a large change in both. Our transcription assays corroborate this idea, demonstrating a small change in transcriptional activity when the number of available binding sites changes (Figure 7).

Using a combination of biophysical methods, structural analysis by NMR and electron microscopy, and cellular transcription assays, we developed a model that proposes a concerted role of intrinsic disorder and multiple LC8 binding events in regulating LC8 transcription. We demonstrate that the long intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain of ASCIZ binds LC8 to form a dynamic ensemble of complexes with a gradient of transcriptional activity that is inversely proportional to LC8 occupancy. The preference for low occupancy complexes at saturating LC8 concentrations with both human and <i>Drosophila</i> ASCIZ indicates that negative cooperativity is an important feature of ASCIZ-LC8 interactions. The prevalence of intrinsic disorder and multivalency among transcription factors suggests that formation of heterogeneous, dynamic complexes is a widespread mechanism for tuning transcriptional regulation.",

As the number of LC8 molecules bound to ASCIZ increased, the rate of transcription dropped. However, all of the binding sites were rarely fully occupied. Instead, three to four attached LC8 molecules seemed to be sufficient to ensure that LC8 levels remain balanced. When the number of LC8 molecules exceeded this value, the attachment rate for additional LC8 slowed down. So, even when there was an excess of LC8, most of the human ASCIZ binding sites were only partially filled. This way, the production of LC8 proteins was slowed, rather than fully shut down. As a result, the cells were able to fine-tune the transcription rate of LC8 and maintain a stable and balanced pool of these proteins.",

LC8 binding is associated with a range of cellular processes, from cell division to apoptosis, underscoring LC8’s essential role as a regulatory hub (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dunsch et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Puthalakath et al., 1999</a>). LC8 preferentially binds to a 10-amino acid motif in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) containing highly conserved TQT residues at positions 7–9 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Barbar, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Rapali et al., 2011b</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>).

Analysis of the 11 crystal structures of LC8 bound to short peptides containing the motif explains why the TQT residues are essential for binding: the Q is involved in interactions with both LC8 subunits in the dimer, while both T’s are fully buried and thus evolutionarily constrained. In these interactions, TQT acts as the motif anchor while the other seven highly variable motif residues modulate affinity, as described in the <i>anchored flexibility model</i> of LC8 motif recognition (<a href=\"#bib12\">Clark et al., 2016</a>). LC8 binds one motif in each of its two symmetrical binding grooves (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>), creating an IDP duplex that serves as a bivalent scaffold. This scaffold aids in higher order complex assembly by promoting binding of other proteins, including additional LC8 dimers (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>), and enhancing self-association and oligomerization processes that often involve coiled-coil formation (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hall et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kidane et al., 2013</a>). In recent years, the number of experimentally characterized LC8 partners has risen to more than 40, and prediction methods indicate that dozens more may specifically bind LC8 (<a href=\"#bib59\">Rapali et al., 2011b</a>). Gaining insight into how LC8 interacts with partner proteins, and how LC8 levels in the cell are balanced, is therefore paramount to understanding the regulation of many cellular processes.",

Disruption of the ASCIZ/LC8 interaction via mutation of the TQT sites results in an increased level of LC8 transcription, while overexpression of LC8 decreases transcription (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jurado et al., 2012a</a>). This observation led to the hypothesis that ASCIZ acts as a sensor for cellular LC8 and regulates LC8 transcription levels according to cellular needs (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jurado et al., 2012a</a>).

The disordered region has six predicted LC8 recognition sites identified by a canonical TQT motif (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>, dark blue bars): QT1 (residues 251–262), QT2 (274–285), QT4 (323–334), QT5 (340–351), QT6 (354–365), and QT7 (374–385). QT3 (285–296) lacks the TQT residues but is identified experimentally as an LC8 recognition site in this work (below). Purification of full-length dASCIZ is impeded by poor expression levels and insolubility, and therefore we designed and produced constructs corresponding to the zinc finger domain, dZnF (residues 1–156, red bar <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>), and the LC8-binding domain, dLBD (residues 241–388, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>).",

The CD spectrum of dZnF shows a large negative ellipticity at 208 nm and a small negative ellipticity at 222 nm (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>, red) indicative of a mix of alpha helices and loops, similar to CD spectra of other ZnF proteins (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ezomo et al., 2010</a>). The dLBD CD spectrum has a large negative ellipticity at 200 nm, indicating that it is primarily disordered (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>, blue). From 5D NMR experiments, backbone assignments for 90% of the 148 residues in dLBD were obtained (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>). A high level of disorder in dLBD is revealed by the limited amide proton chemical shift dispersion in <sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>), and a lack of secondary structure preference is further supported by small ΔCα-ΔCβ chemical shift differences from random coil values (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>).

Plots of the continuous size distribution, c(S), vs. sedimentation coefficient (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>) show that titration at sub-saturating concentrations of LC8 results in a broad peak that is likely an equilibrium mixture of complexes with varying LC8 occupancy in exchange with each other and with free dLBD. At a saturating concentration of LC8 (1:10 ratio), a high occupancy complex whose size (7.5 s) approximately corresponds to a fully bound complex (197 kDa) is clearly evident. Contrary to expectations, a low stoichiometry complex (5 s, approx. 114 kDa) is even more highly populated. A high frictional ratio (<i>f</i>/<i>f<sub>0</sub></i> ~ 1.6) indicates an elongated complex, and the molecular weight of this low occupancy complex corresponds roughly to a 1:3 complex, although its broadness, and the approximate nature of the molecular weight determination, indicate that multiple species are present.

When unbound, dLBD and LC8 each migrate as a single band. When LC8 is added to dLBD at a 1:1 molar ratio, the band for free LC8 disappears, and the complexes formed migrate above LC8, as a diffuse band likely corresponding to two dLBD chains bound to two or more LC8 dimers (since some free dLBD persists). As the molar ratio is increased, the diffuse upper band becomes a dark smear, free LC8 accumulates in a pronounced dark band, and the free dLBD band disappears. We think the most likely explanation is that the decreasing mobility of the upper edge of the smear indicates increasing sizes of the complexes formed. Unbound LC8 is clearly visible at ratios ≥ 1:4, indicating that a pool of free LC8 accumulates even at conditions well below LC8 saturation of dLBD.",

Very similar behavior is observed for hLBD, although the gel mobility of hLBD bands is much lower than the mobility of dLBD bands due to molecular sieving of the much larger hLBD (53 kDa) compared to dLBD (17 kDa). Molecular sieving is the dominate effect on hLBD mobility as both hLBD and dLBD are disordered and highly extended and have a pI of ~4. As LC8 is added to hLBD, the free hLBD band disappears and a lower mobility smear becomes increasingly evident. Decreasing mobility of the upper smear indicates increasing sizes of the complexes formed, while the appearance of a bands migrating the same as free LC8 at ratios ≥ 1:4 indicates the presence of a pool of free LC8 well below LC8 saturation of hLBD. Together the gel titration data for dLBD and hLBD suggest that hLBD:LC8 complexes form a dynamic ensemble with varying levels of LC8 occupancy in which lower occupancy forms are favored.",

Here, the amount of hLBD is held constant, and increases in peak intensity are due to effects on hLBD complexes from increasing LC8. Both LMW and HMW complexes form at the first titration point and increase in population as more LC8 is added. A low occupancy intermediate, labeled LMW, is clearly evident at the lowest molar ratio of 1:3, and persists at the same elution volume even at the highest molar ratios. Higher occupancy species, HMW, are also apparent at a ratio of 1:3 and become increasingly distinct as LC8 is increased. The peak corresponding to excess LC8 is discernable at a ratio of 1:7, and steadily increases as LC8 is added. Taken together, the data in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> are consistent with the explanation that a low occupancy form of the hLBD:LC8 complex is favored even with a large excess of LC8. A minor population of high occupancy complexes, present even at the lowest molar ratio, increases with increasing LC8 and is in equilibrium with the LMW species and with free LC8, and therefore with each other. Both <i>Drosophila</i> and human LBD exhibit this dynamic behavior, suggesting it is a conserved feature of the ASCIZ:LC8 interaction.",

These produced 2D projection averages for dLBD:LC8 and hLBD:LC8 oligomers displaying complexes formed with 2–4 stacked densities, corresponding to LC8 dimers, deduced from the dimensions of the averaged bead-like densities (~4 nm diameter) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Benison et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Stelter et al., 2007</a>).

Both dLBD:LC8 and hLBD:LC8 complexes form an ensemble of structures, displaying an exponential distribution with low-occupancy states (<i>i.e.</i> 2–4 stacked LC8 dimers) being most abundant (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c,d</a>).

For the hLBD:LC8 dataset, complexes containing as many as 7–9 LC8 dimers could be distinguished from the single particle image data, while higher-order complexes containing 10–11 LC8 dimers were either not distinguishable or were simply absent under the limiting concentrations required for negative stain EM specimen preparation. Nevertheless, the remarkable similarity in distribution of oligomeric species formed by dLBD and hLBD, obtained under similar binding conditions, is consistent with the nearly equivalent overall LC8 affinity determined by ITC, and suggests that a conserved mechanism of negative cooperativity is used by ASCIZ to regulate the formation and distribution of higher-order LC8 assemblies.",

Notably, the linear assembly pattern of LC8 dimers observed by negative stain EM suggests an ordered (or quasi-ordered) sequence of assembly, apparently favoring neighboring TQT sites. However, the location of LC8 binding sites could not be resolved in these experiments. Therefore, to examine interactions between individual motifs and LC8 in the context of the full dLBD, we turned to NMR. As unlabeled LC8 is titrated into solutions of <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>13</sup>C- labeled dLBD, changes in NH peak intensities can be measured in 3D HNCO spectra recorded for dLBD:LC8 molar ratios of 1:0.25, 1:1, 1:2, 1:5, 1:8. As LC8 concentration increases, a corresponding decrease in dLBD peak intensity is observed (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>). At a molar ratio of 1:5, less than 10% of the original peak intensity remains at all seven LC8 binding sites. At a ratio of 1:8, all dLBD peaks completely disappear except for peaks corresponding to eight N-terminal residues (241-248), indicating that all TQT sites have been occupied to some degree. The absence of peaks for bound dLBD is attributed to line broadening associated with intermediate exchange processes and/or faster transverse relaxation as a result of increased complex size. Therefore, we consider a decrease in peak intensity as a measure of increased complex formation.",

To confirm this observation and to obtain titration information for the missing residues in this region, we performed similar experiments on the smaller QT2-4 and QT4-6 constructs. QT2-4 was chosen to further validate LC8 binding to the QT3 motif that as an individual peptide showed weak binding by ITC, and QT4-6 was chosen because it has the highest LC8 binding affinity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). Further, the two constructs share the QT4 motif, allowing us to assess its affinity in two sequence contexts. Due to the smaller number of peaks for shorter constructs, HSQC spectra have a sufficiently high resolution to render an HNCO-based titration unnecessary. Unlabeled LC8 was titrated into <sup>15</sup>N-labeled QT2-4 or QT4-6 and changes in peak intensity were analyzed (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b,c</a>). As with dLBD, there is a gradual decrease in peak intensity as more LC8 is added to QT2-4 or to QT4-6 at molar ratios: 1:0.25, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4. Significantly, peak intensities in QT4-6 decrease at lower LC8 ratio than in QT2-4, confirming the trend we observe in full-length dLBD. In QT4-6, nearly all peaks in the motif region disappear at a ratio of 1:2, while ~30% of peak intensity remains in QT2-4.",

In dLBD, the first three (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d</a>) show a different titration pattern and weaker binding than the last four motifs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6e</a>). This dichotomy is replicated in separate plots of the 3 QT motifs in each of the constructs QT2-4 and QT4-6; the average I/I<sub>0</sub> of motifs in QT2-4 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6f</a>) drops to 0.2 at LC8 molar ratio 1:2, twice that observed for motifs in QT4-6 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6g</a>) which reach the same I/I<sub>0</sub> at molar ratio 1:1. The apparently higher LC8 affinity of motifs 4–6 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6e,g</a>), relative to motifs 2–4 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d,f</a>) is consistent with our ITC experiments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). The QT4 motif, common to both constructs, has a different rate of peak disappearance in each construct, suggesting that motif environment, not local sequence, determines its affinity. We conclude that the recognition motifs QT4-QT7 are the sites favored in stable low occupancy complexes.",

Empty vector and the ΔZnF construct showed limited transcriptional activity compared to ASCIZ constructs. Most significantly, transcriptional activity of the AAA mutants can be ranked to form an activity gradient (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7c</a>) notable for a clear inverse relationship between their transcriptional activity and their affinity for LC8. While the differences between each construct are very small, the overall trend supports the hypothesis that affinity and transcriptional activity are correlated. The construct with the highest affinity for LC8 by ITC, AAA8-11, exhibits equal or slightly lower transcriptional activity than WT ASCIZ, while the construct with the lowest affinity for LC8, AAA1-4, 8–11, has 2.5x the activity of WT ASCIZ.

We tested the main features of this model in cells using transcription activity assays which show a trend wherein mutant ASCIZ constructs with lower LC8 occupancy display higher transcriptional activity, while constructs with higher LC8 occupancy have lower activity. We propose that a dynamic ensemble of complexes is important for fine-tuning ASCIZ transcriptional activity, where stable, low occupancy complexes function to maintain a basal buffering transcription rate for LC8. A change in LC8 cellular concentration would shift this dynamic equilibrium to a higher or lower occupancy state without dramatically altering the level of transcription. As LC8 is an essential regulator of dozens of cellular processes, an ability to maintain an LC8 ‘buffer’ is likely important for cellular homeostasis.

Nup159 cooperatively binds five LC8 dimers and forms a relatively stable complex readily visible by electron microscopy and 2D classification analysis (<a href=\"#bib65\">Stelter et al., 2007</a>). As Nup159 has a slightly lower affinity for LC8 than ASCIZ (2.9 μM vs. 0.9 μM, respectively (<a href=\"#bib51\">Nyarko et al., 2013</a>), the difference between the Nup159 grids with uniformly stacked structures and the ASCIZ grids with sparse and heterogeneous structures of 2–4 stacked LC8 dimers is intriguing. This difference in structural heterogeneity can be attributed to the higher flexibility or short life time of ASCIZ:LC8 complexes relative to Nup159:LC8 complexes, while the scarcity of high-occupancy states is consistent with a unique mode of negative cooperativity. Given the different function of Nup159 (in nuclear pore assembly) versus ASCIZ:LC8 complexes (transcription regulation), the data suggest that the dynamic properties and unique mechanism of assembly that is conserved in LC8-ASCIZ complexes may reflect an important feature required for autoregulation of LC8 transcription.",

A change in LC8 cellular concentration would shift this dynamic equilibrium to a higher or lower occupancy state without dramatically altering the level of transcription. All 11 (or 7) binding sites are therefore occupied in the heterogeneous mixture of complexes, as is demonstrated by NMR titration (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), and participate in maintaining a homeostatic concentration of LC8. Thus, it is ensured that a high concentration of LC8 does not drastically decrease LC8 production, but rather shifts it to a lower level. As LC8 is a hub protein that interacts with &gt;40 protein partners, and is predicted to bind to 100 additional proteins from a diverse selection of cellular pathways (<a href=\"#bib59\">Rapali et al., 2011b</a>), maintaining a constant level of its transcription is essential.",

Constructs of the dASCIZ zinc finger domain (ZnF) and the LC8 binding domain (dLBD) were generated by cloning residues 1–156 or 241–388, respectively, of <i>Drosophila</i> ASCIZ into the pET2Zt2-1a vector. The constructs were expressed in frame with a hexahistidine tag, Protein A solubility tag, and cleavage site for the tobacco etch virus (TEV) enzyme.

Individual frames were processed automatically and independently within the EDNA framework, yielding individual radially averaged curves of normalized intensity versus scattering angle s = 4πSinθ/λ. Additional data reduction within EDNA utilizes the automatic data processing tools of EMBL-Hamburg ATSAS package (M. V. K. Petoukhov, P. V.; Kikhney A. G.; Svergun D. I., 2007), to combine timeframes, excluding any data points affected by aggregation induced by radiation damage, yielding the average scattering curve for each exposure series. Matched buffer measurements taken before and after every sample were averaged and used for background subtraction. Merging of separate concentrations and further analysis steps were performed manually using the tools of the ATSAS package (M. V. K. Petoukhov, P. V.; Kikhney A. G.; Svergun D. I., 2007) (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_015648\">SCR_015648</a>). The forward scattering I(0) radius of gyration, Rg were calculated from the Guinier approximation (A., 1938), the hydrated particle volume was computed using the Porod invariant (<a href=\"#bib55\">Porod, 1982</a>) and the maximum particle size D<sub>max</sub>, was determined from the pair distribution function computed by GNOM (<a href=\"#bib66\">Svergun, 1992</a>) using PRIMUS.",

Using FuGENE 6 (Promega), immortalized ASCIZ knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jurado et al., 2010</a>) were co-transfected with ASCIZ constructs, the Dynll1 promoter, and a pRL-CMV vector containing <i>Renilla</i> luciferase for normalization of firefly/luciferase ratios. The authenticity of the ASCIZ knockout MEF cell line was verified by PCR genotyping of the ASCIZ locus. The cell line tested to be free from mycoplasma contamination using a MycoAlert mycoplasma detection kit (Lonza, Switzerland). 24 hr after transfection, cells were transferred to 96-well plates and incubated overnight before determining reporter gene activities using the dual-luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega) and a Polarstar Optima (BMG Labtechnologies, Germany) instrument. For assessment of protein expression levels, human U2OS cells were transfected with ASCIZ constructs using FuGENE six and were probed with ASCIZ antibody (<a href=\"#bib45\">McNees et al., 2005</a>).",

Yet there were some reservations about the novelty, with significantly more experiments required at the in-vitro and cellular level to prove the hypothesis regarding the feedback mechanism regulating expression. In addition, it was felt that the work would be strengthened by additional NMR experiments to more fully characterize the binding.

The authors come up with a mechanism whereby the disordered domain of the transcription factor ASCIZ is able to bind multiple copies of LC8, in effect, sensing its concentration and controlling levels of transcription of the LC8 gene through a competition with activator binding. Overall this is an exciting development, but I do believe that the work could be clarified by consideration of a number of points below.",

The major insight by NMR is that there are two different classes of binding regions that bind either 3 or 4 LC8 dimers with different affinities. Yet little mechanism into binding order to sites within these classes is obtained and as the authors mention the affinities are very different from ITC. Can the authors look at say smaller constructs that contain only 3 or only the 4 dimer sites in an effort to circumvent the issue with disappearing peaks? Indeed even smaller constructs would allow to address whether at low stoichiometries there is preferential binding to one of the sites, whether there is exchange between sites and what both the kinetics and thermodynamics might be.",

I don't understand why the 1:3 can’t be saturated (pushed to fully bound) – simply thermodynamics would dictate this unless there is some sort of structural change. What is the mechanism involved here? And what are the implications for transcription, since even at very high concentrations of LC8 it appears that there will be some activation, which seems wasteful. The authors need to discuss this point more fully in terms of what the biological ramifications are/mean.",

Others have reported that ASCIZ regulates the expression of LC8 in certain cell types, and in some cancer cell lines, and that disruption of this regulatory circuit is associated with mitotic defects seen previously with loss of LC8. In addition, others have reported that the CTR of ASCIZ contains multiple short linear motifs (SLIMs) with the sequence TQT known to bind to LC8. Here, the authors characterized seven LC8 binding SLIMs within the CTR of <i>Drosophila</i> ASCIZ using ITC, AUC, and NMR. As LC8 was titrated into the ASCIZ CTR, a mixture of sub-stoichiometric and 1:7 complexes were formed, presumably with two CTRs stitched together by multiple LC8 dimers (as proposed by the authors). Mutagenesis of several different combinations of multiple SLIMs confirmed their LC8 binding properties and allowed the rank order of their μM affinities to be determined. The authors noted that the affinity of the CTR, with multiple binding sites, for LC8 was higher than that of isolated binding site, but this point was not rigorously addressed in the manuscript. The authors extended their studies to the CTR of human ASCIZ, which they showed contains 11 LC8 binding SLIMs using ITC and mutagenesis. Finally, the authors performed a Luc-reporter transcription assay using wt and mutant ASCIZ expressed in ASCIZ null MEFs, which showed that mutation of LC8 binding SLIMs was associated with a slight increase in expression of the luc reporter. This latter finding suggests that LC8 exerts negative feedback on its expression by binding to the SLIMs within the CTR of ASCIZ, possibly altering DNA binding and/or interactions with other transcription factors. While the authors' hypothesis regarding this negative feedback mechanism is novel and interesting, the data in the manuscript fall well short of proving the hypothesis. Much more extensive in vitro and in cell data would be needed to establish the LC8 concentration dependence of the negative feedback circuit and further data required to elucidate the associated mechanism of feedback. In addition, the new knowledge gained regarding the identification of LC8 binding SLIMs within fly and human ASCIZ seems incremental with respect to the 2011 BBRC report from Rapali, et al. Therefore, the manuscript does not provide the level of rigor, novelty and impact associated with <i>eLife</i> but rather would be more suitable for a more technical journal.",

Results clearly support a model with a dynamic (based on NMR) mixture of complexes with different LC8 occupancies (based on centrifugation) and with ASCIZ engaging LC8 at multiple different motifs.

In addition to the caveats mentioned by the authors, there is a strong possibility of intramolecular interactions leading to a lower intensity in the free LBD with binding to LC8 disrupting these intramolecular interactions and leading to increase of intensity for some LBD regions. This should be acknowledged and is especially important given the suggestion of \"slightly more ordered structure in its C-terminal half\" of the LBD. (Note that \"ordered\" would be better described as \"transient\", given the overall disordered nature of the LBD.) The differing apparent correlation times for LBD residues depending on distances from direct LC8 binding site(s) on the LBD and from the termini should also be acknowledged (P Wright and J Dyson). The complexity of interpretation of intensities needs to be laid out even if trying to make a simple interpretation. Ultimately, this reviewer is not convinced of the validity of the \"two sub-domains\" identified based on these different Kd and cooperativity values, due to the lack of ability to quantify local affinities from the NMR intensities.",

Using a combination of methods that include SAXS, AUC, gel filtration, native gel, and negative stain electron microscopy, we demonstrate that both the human and <i>Drosophila</i> proteins form a dynamic complex with LC8. Our cell culture transcription assays show a gradient of ASCIZ activity that depends on the number of LC8 dimers bound.

The consensus was that the biophysical characterization of a difficult system was strong, while the in-vitro and cellular experiments to prove the hypothesis regarding the feedback mechanism regulating expression were weaker. At issue is that while the overall trend regarding binding and activity is consistent with your claims, the effect is small (Figure 7D) and the errors are large, and in some cases it appears that the differences in the points corresponding to different Kd's are not statistically significant. It was the consensus of the reviewers that a revision should focus more on the biophysics, while suggesting biological relevance through the presentation of the transcription data. If possible, additional transcriptional experiments that attempt to decrease errors to strengthen this section would be recommended but are not required.

Instead of progressively binding more LC8 as it becomes available, our model suggests that ASCIZ’s multiple sites function as a “buffer” for LC8 concentration and aid in maintaining a homeostatic concentration. For example, an increase in LC8 cellular concentration would cause a small shift in the complex equilibrium towards a higher occupancy state and a corresponding decrease in the level of transcription, instead of causing a large change in both. Our transcription assays corroborate this idea, demonstrating a small change in transcriptional activity when the number of available binding sites changes (Figure 7). As LC8 is a ubiquitous protein that binds to hundreds of partners, the need to maintain a stable level of LC8 is likely necessary.",
