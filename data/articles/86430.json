In many situations, humans retrieve these dependencies even from limited datasets. However, this learning at multiple scale levels is poorly understood. Here we used the formalism proposed by network science to study the representation of local and higher-order structures and their interaction in auditory sequences. We show that human adults exhibited biases in their perception of local transitions between elements, which made them sensitive to high-order network structures such as communities. This behavior is consistent with the creation of a parsimonious simpliﬁed model from the evidence they receive, achieved by pruning and completing relationships between network elements. This observation suggests that the brain does not rely on exact memories but on a parsimonious representation of the world. Moreover, this bias can be analytically modeled by a memory/eﬃciency trade-off. This model correctly accounts for previous ﬁndings, including local transition probabilities as well as high-order network structures, unifying sequence learning across scales. We ﬁnally propose putative brain implementations of such bias.",

In many situations, humans retrieve these dependencies even from limited datasets. However, this learning at multiple scale levels is poorly understood. Here, we used the formalism proposed by network science to study the representation of local and higher-order structures and their interaction in auditory sequences. We show that human adults exhibited biases in their perception of local transitions between elements, which made them sensitive to high-order network structures such as communities. This behavior is consistent with the creation of a parsimonious simpliﬁed model from the evidence they receive, achieved by pruning and completing relationships between network elements. This observation suggests that the brain does not rely on exact memories but on a parsimonious representation of the world. Moreover, this bias can be analytically modeled by a memory/efficiency trade-off. This model correctly accounts for previous findings, including local transition probabilities as well as high-order network structures, unifying sequence learning across scales. We finally propose putative brain implementations of such bias.",

Network science - an emerging interdisciplinary field - thus proposed a different description to characterize more complex streams (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lynn et al., 2020</a>). In this framework, a stream of stimuli corresponds to a random walk in the associated probabilistic network. Several studies used this network approach to investigate how humans encode visual sequential information (<a href=\"#bib21\">Garvert et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Mark et al., 2020</a>). <a href=\"#bib46\">Schapiro et al., 2013</a>, tested human adults with a network consisting of three communities (i.e. sets of nodes densely connected with each other and poorly connected with the rest of the graph; <a href=\"#bib33\">Newman, 2003</a>) where transitions between all elements were equiprobable (each node had the same degree). This community structure is an extreme version of the communities and clustering properties that are often found in real-life networks, whether social, biological, or phonological (<a href=\"#bib22\">Girvan and Newman, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Karuza et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Siew, 2013</a>). The authors reported that subjects discriminated transitions between communities from those within communities. Since local properties (TP) were not informative, this result revealed participants’ sensitivity to higher-order properties not covered by local probabilistic models. This sensitivity seems already to be in place at 6y-o (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pudhiyidath et al., 2020</a>). Recently, <a href=\"#bib29\">Lynn et al., 2020</a>, replicated a similar effect with a probabilistic sequential response task. They presented subjects with sequences of visual stimuli that followed a random walk into a network composed of three communities. After each stimulus, subjects were asked to press one or two computer keys, and their reaction time was measured as a proxy of the predictability of the stimulus. To explain the response pattern, the authors proposed an analytical model that optimizes the trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity by minimizing the free energy function. This model allows taking into account the probability of memory errors in the computation of the TPs between the elements of the stream. From now on, we will refer to this model as the free energy minimization model (FEMM: model D, explained below).",

Moreover, we propose that adults do not encode the exact input but a parsimonious version based on the generalization of the underlying structure. To this end, we leveraged the community network framework and adapted it to expose adult participants to rapid sequences of sounds that followed a random walk through a network, building on the studies described above (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lynn et al., 2020</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Schapiro et al., 2013</a>), but using sparse communities with missing transitions between elements of the same community (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). This design allows investigating whether participants are able to complete the network according to the high-order structure or whether, on the contrary, they rely on local transitions and reject impossible transitions ignoring the high-order structure. In other words, after training with an incomplete network, if new (‘unheard’) transitions are presented, are participants more willing to accept them if they belong to the community (i.e. within community transitions) than if they occur between communities? Moreover, while several papers have studied network learning in the visual domain (<a href=\"#bib26\">Karuza et al., 2019</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lynn et al., 2020</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Schapiro et al., 2013</a>), to our knowledge, it has never been tested in the auditory domain despite the better statistical learning capacities in the auditory modality (<a href=\"#bib12\">Conway and Christiansen, 2005</a>), the sophisticated auditory sequence processing abilities observed in humans compared to other primates (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dehaene et al., 2015</a>), and their potential importance in language acquisition. In addition, the original design was at a very slow rate, allowing for possible conscious decision to take place on the adequation of each element of the sequence to the structure. Here, we used a 4 Hz presentation, typically used in auditory sequence learning tasks, in order to force rapid processing of each element of the sequence and to be more comparable to the sequence learning literature. Finally, we compared how the different models proposed in the literature might fit our data and proposed a unified hypothesis of how any structure (local or global) might be extracted from a sequence.",

It can be explained by memory errors while computing TP between elements in a stream. Participants exposed to a stream of elements reinforce the association between element i and i-1. However, errors in this process may lead participants to sometimes bind element i with element i-2, i-3, i-4.... with a decreasing probability (for a full description of the model, see <a href=\"#bib29\">Lynn et al., 2020</a>). Mathematically, the distribution of the error size that minimizes the free energy function is a decreasing exponential (Boltzmann distribution). Therefore, the estimated mental model of TP is biased compared to the streams' objective TPs enabling participants to encode high-order structure. In more detail, the mental model is a linear combination of the TP matrix (A) and non-adjacent TPs of every order (A<sup>∆t</sup>) with a weight of P (∆t) where ∆t is the order of non-adjacency (or size of the memory error, i.e. ∆t = n corresponds to P (E<sub>t</sub>|X.....XE<sub>t−n</sub>)).

Second, concerning the new transitions, FEMM and hitting time models predict that participants should better detect <i>new between community</i> than <i>new within community transitions (completion effect</i>). It is also partly the case for the communicability model, but not for the TP and non-adjacent TP models (models A and B). The similarity of the predictions of FEMM, hitting time, and communicability models is not surprising as they all describe the same property of the network: proximity between nodes. Intuitively, items from the same community will appear closer together than items from different communities, even if the two nodes are not connected. In fact, FEMM and communicability are mathematically very close but with a different decay (exponential vs. factorial).

In all three paradigms (each corresponding to a graph in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), the significant increase in key presses after between community vs. within community transitions (p&lt;0.05 are indicated in bold lines) reveals that participants were sensitive to the switch between sound communities.

This task is the crucial test for comparing models because it allows to present new transitions that matched, or not, the familiar structure and thus to assess the representation of the memorized graph. We report the results at the end of the learning (second block). Results separated by groups and testing block are presented in SI. It can be seen that in contrast with the three other data points, participants’ choice were close to random after the first block in the syllable experiment and their performance could not be explained by any of the models. As pointed in other experiments on statistical learning using syllables (<a href=\"#bib17\">Elazar et al., 2022</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Onnis and Thiessen, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Siegelman et al., 2018</a>), the familiarity with speech and the phonetic rules of the native language create priors on the probability of sequences of syllables, that might compete with the real syllable distribution in the task. At the end of learning, no difference was found between the groups using tones and syllables (unpaired t-test for each condition, all ps &gt;0.2), we thus merged the data of the tone and syllable groups.",

It is worth noticing that models A, B, C, and F predict differences in familiarity for familiar within transitions between the three paradigms (full, sparse, high sparse); however, our experimental design does not allow us to estimate differences in these transitions between paradigms but only relative differences to the <i>familiar within community</i> condition within paradigms. To estimate the significance of the correlation differences, we used a bootstrapping approach with subjects (with replacement) and estimated the number of bootstrap occurrences in favor of one model against another. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> shows the correlations’ distribution between the data and each model (presented on the diagonal) and between pairs of models. We estimated the signiﬁcance of the correlation strength between the data and model <i>i</i> or <i>j</i> by counting the percentage of occurrences in which model <i>i</i> had a stronger correlation with the data than model <i>j</i>. All models were signiﬁcantly correlated with the data (all p&lt;0.01 FDRcorr), with a correlation strength following the order FEMM ≈ hitting time &gt; communicability &gt; non-adjacent TPs ≈ TPs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>).

Here, we show the same analysis with tone and syllables groups separated for the first and second two-forced-choice sessions. The first session in the syllable stream did not show any sensitive pattern congruent with any of the learning model. Moreover, the data from the three different paradigms (full, sparse, high sparse) were not always in accordance. This observation might be related to participants' priors on syllable transition in sequences. Thus, a random walk among syllables strongly contradicts the usual organization of speech. Such a prior would conflict with correct learning of the structure. For tones, the range we used did not belong to any musical scale, limiting priors and making them more appropriate for such task. Nonetheless, after sufficient exposure (second block), the data from the syllable and tone groups no longer differed (none of the conditions were significantly different between the two groups), revealing that participants were able to overcome their priors about the organization of syllable sequences and learned the graph structure in the same way as in the tone experiment.",

Such learning could be implemented in many brain regions through learning-induced synaptic plasticity and does not require any specific structural organization of neurons. In contrast, the CA1 similarity model relies on the specific architecture of the hippocampus. Testing a hippocampus specific model is essential because several authors have proposed that statistical learning and graph learning might be represented as the construction of an abstract map of relational knowledge, analogous to topographic maps (<a href=\"#bib11\">Constantinescu et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Garvert et al., 2017</a>), which are known to involve the hippocampus.

Using the community paradigm with fMRI, <a href=\"#bib47\">Schapiro et al., 2016</a>, also reported an increased pattern similarity in the hippocampus for elements belonging to the same community (see also <a href=\"#bib42\">Pudhiyidath et al., 2022</a>).

In this study, the authors used a neural model mimicking the hippocampus architecture and trained it on different statistical learning tasks including community structure learning. They showed that the pattern of activity in CA1 might account for both pair learning (episodic memory) and community structure learning, and thus is partially consistent with two mechanisms observed in the hippocampus: pattern completion (i.e. the similarity of the neural representations of close stimuli increases, which allows generalization) and pattern separation (i.e. the similarity of neural representation of close stimuli decreases, to disambiguate them) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bakker et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Liu et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Yassa and Stark, 2011</a>).",

However, the exact model explaining statistical learning remains under-speciﬁed: What is computed remains unclear (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fló et al., 2022</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Henin et al., 2021</a>) and authors often tailored the computation to suit the paradigm (TPs in some studies, non-adjacent or backward TPs in others, biased transitions probabilities in network studies, etc.). We argue that the FEMM is a more general model that, beyond explaining community separation, as shown above, can also account for results traditionally explained by the computation of local transitional probabilities and those that require the computation of long-distance dependencies. Indeed, the ﬁrst-order approximation of the FEMM corresponds to the objective TPs model (<math id=\"inf17\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><msub><mrow><mover><mi>A</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover></mrow><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow></mstyle></math>, see SI). Thus, the predictions of the FEMM are the same as those of the TP model in many tasks, notably in classical speech segmentation experiments, where a drop in TP signals word edges (<a href=\"#bib45\">Saffran et al., 1996</a>). Another approach in the literature about sequence learning considers the recognition of chunks more than statistical learning as a primary mechanism for segmenting sequences. Based on this approach, PARSER and TRAXCS detect often occurring chunks in sequences but do not associate a familiarity rating with each transition. In a previous experiment (<a href=\"#bib9\">Benjamin et al., 2023</a>), we showed that familiarity based on statistical learning does not always lead to sequence chunking and here we focused on this sense of familiarity which does not require the construction of a repertoire of possible chunks postulated by chunking models. Therefore, we did not consider these models here.",

The computation of first-order TPs is insufficient to solve this task, which requires the encoding of non-adjacent TPs. However, a bias estimation of TPs following the FEMM is sensitive to non-adjacent dependencies and can explain the emergence of AxC structures. Additionally, as previous papers and our results show, the FEMM can also explain subjects’ behavior in different kinds of network learning (<a href=\"#bib25\">Karuza et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lynn et al., 2020</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Schapiro et al., 2013</a>). <a href=\"#bib29\">Lynn et al., 2020</a>, interpret the FEMM as errors in the associations between elements, whose probability decays with the distance between associated elements.

A similar idea has recently been proposed by <a href=\"#bib18\">Endress and Johnson, 2021</a>. However, the authors did not refer to free energy optimum or provide an analytical approach. Instead, they proposed a Hebbian learning rule with the same idea of mixing TP with non-adjacent TP (which corresponds to a second-order approximation of the FEMM that we propose here, see <math id=\"inf18\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><msub><mrow><mover><mi>A</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover></mrow><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow></mstyle></math> in SI). Like we do here, they argued that this mechanism could account for results currently explained by different models in the literature. Thus, the FEMM and its putative neural implementation through Hebbian rules uniﬁes different proposals concerning statistical learning on the one hand and network learning results on the other hand, under a common principle. It is important to note that we investigated how the FEMM - and the other models - accounts for the extraction of regularity from a sequence, which is the first needed step of many other processes. We did not test for further abstract representations of the sequence that could be subsequently computed.",

In fact, the extraction of high-order structures might enable information compression in long-term memory. Because of the computational cost and the pressure on memory to encode long sequences, compressing information is a major advantage. In a community paradigm, the learned representation could be later simplified to reduce the stream complexity to a binary sequence with a certain probability of changing between communities A and B (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Instead of remembering all the transitions of the stream, remembering community labels and the probability of transition between communities is sufficient. Recent data (<a href=\"#bib1\">Al Roumi et al., 2021</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dehaene et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Planton et al., 2021</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sablé-Meyer et al., 2022</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sablé-Meyer et al., 2021</a>) showed that in some circumstances, humans’ performances were highly sensitive to input compressibility, arguing for a condensed encoding of inputs. Note that the familiarity measure we report here does not show compression of the structure. Still, the familiarity bias could be at the basis of a later abstract condensed network representation (this hypothesis is presented in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). In the same line, a recent study using a graph perspective (<a href=\"#bib55\">Whittington et al., 2020</a>) proposes that the representation of the abstract relational structure of a sequence and the mapping between node and stimuli identity could be factorized. In the case of community paradigm, <a href=\"#bib42\">Pudhiyidath et al., 2022</a>, even proposed that the formation of such an abstract structure could allow humans to transfer learnt properties between elements belonging to the same community. <a href=\"#bib32\">Mark et al., 2020</a>, showed that the learning of the structure of a network could be re-used on the next day to allow fast and generalizable learning arguing for a factorized brain representation between the stimuli mapping and the abstract network encoding. This compressibility hypothesis, represented in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, needs formal testing to be confirmed or infirmed.",

To avoid any putative acoustical bias, we collected eight groups of subjects for each paradigm.

In the Hamiltonian path, each node is presented only once, avoiding short distance repetitions and thus controlling for a putative novelty effect when there is a change of community which could potentially serve as a parsing cue in a random walk. However, participants did not parse the sequences better in the case of random walks relative to Hamiltonian walks (Figure 2 in <a href=\"#bib47\">Schapiro et al., 2016</a>) minimizing the concern of a possible habituation effect if random walks are used. Here, we chose a random walk because the Hamiltonian path introduces more predictability to the sequence. As previously presented stimuli of the community can no longer be presented, the predictability of the next element increases with the length of the path within a community until a perfect predictability for the fifth and sixth elements (node at the border of communities) and the next element in the other community whereas a random walk keeps the prediction flat. Thus, learning a graph through a Hamiltonian walk can be fully explained with Ngram approaches and cannot disentangle the different learning models proposed. Moreover, the number of Hamiltonian paths available drastically decreases with sparsity up to the point where, in the high sparse paradigm, a single sequence is possible of a given first element leading to a trivial pattern of repetition of 12 elements.",

However, the length of the walk within one community can be short without repetition or without going through all the tones of the community, or longer with repetition of some tones at a random distance. Therefore, there is no consistency over time that could allow to capture a repetition pattern. Furthermore, the absolute frequency of each tone is equal within the stream, which avoids long-term habituation effects, and the local TP is flat, which avoids the possibility of predicting the next tone. Finally, the tones frequency was distributed between the two communities, to prevent a separation based on an auditory spectral partition. However, due to the design reasons explained before, Halmitonian walks are not usable and thus we could not formally control for potential habituation effect in our design. The key-press results of this study (but not the two-forced-choice results) are therefore potentially subject to confounding by habituation.",

To convert it into a continuous signal, we convoluted it with an exponential window. Then, we epoched this continuous signal from –2.75 to 2.75 s after each transition’s offset. Finally, we averaged all the epochs corresponding to the four familiar between community transitions and four out of all familiar within community transitions, and compared them. We repeated this with 1000 random groups of four familiar within community transitions in each subject. By normalizing and averaging across subjects, we were able to estimate the increase of the pressing probability after a familiar between community transition compared to a familiar within community transition at each time point.

For each subject, we computed a percentage of preference for the tested transition relative to the reference (<i>familiar within community</i> transition) in each condition (i.e. the ratio between the number of trials where the subject chose the tested sequence and the total number of trials of this condition). The measure ranges from 0 (the <i>familiar within community</i> transition is always selected) to 100 (the other transition is always selected) with a chance level of 50%. We estimated the familiarity score of each condition vs the chance level (50%) using paired t-tests. We report the data from the second forced-choice-task session, corresponding to the maximum exposure to the streams. For the tone stream, results were similar in the ﬁrst and second sessions. For the syllable stream, results from the ﬁrst session were poorly consistent across participants, probably because the task was more difficult in the case of syllables. Indeed, flat transitions between syllables violate language structure and participants’ priors on syllable sequences. The conflict between priors and the real structure of the sequence might need a variable time to be resolved by each participant (<a href=\"#bib17\">Elazar et al., 2022</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lew-Williams and Saffran, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Onnis and Thiessen, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Siegelman et al., 2018</a>). For completeness, we performed the correlation analysis with each subgroup of data (ﬁrst vs. second session and tones vs. syllables). These analyses are presented in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</a>. None of the models could adequately explain the first session of the syllable group. To further investigate the learning dynamics and in particular the influence of priors, another paradigm should be proposed, which is beyond the scope of the present study.",

We did not change any parameter from this original study because our goal was to see how predictable this model was for our paradigms. We trained it 25 times on each of our graph structures (for each paradigm, 25 batches for 8 groups with syllables and 8 groups with tones: 25*8*2=400 replications). We then presented after each training each node as input in isolation and recorded the pattern of activity in the CA1 layer. To estimate the similarity in nodes’ encoding, we computed the correlation between the pattern of activity in CA1 for pairs of elements. Finally, we then made predictions on our task by comparing the similarity between two nodes linked by our four types of transitions.",

To achieve that, we declared a layer of neurons with at least one neuron per node of the graph (it can contain more for generalization to bigger networks). The neurons started firing with an exponential decay corresponding to the FEMM decay for each sound in the sequence. Thus, if another sound was presented before the previous neuron stopped firing, several neurons encoding for different nodes co- fired simultaneously. It biased the estimation of TP between two elements. This co-firing behavior can be computed using Hebbian learning rule to update the weights between the neurons. This weight Matrix is then an estimation of the Free Energy Minimization Model that will converge as the length of the input stream increases. To estimate this model, we followed the same procedure as for the Hitting Time. We created 50 000 item-long streams corresponding to each graph and used those streams as inputs of the neural network. We updated the weight matrix at each step using Hebbian rule as described before. The weight matrix after the 50 000 items was used as an estimation of the model.",

To make it comparable with the two-forced-choice data, we normalized each design prediction by the model’s value for <i>familiar within community</i> transitions. We then pooled all data from all paradigms and estimated the correlation between the data and the models’ predictions using 5000 bootstrap re-sampling occurrences. The p-values were estimated by counting the percentage of bootstrap occurrences correlating more with one model compared to another. All the bootstrap occurrences and their correlation with each pair of models are presented in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>. Each dot represents one bootstrap occurrence. The distribution of these dots below and above the diagonal indicates the comparison between two models. The scatterplot’s shape shows the correlation, independence, or anti-correlation between two models. This main analysis of data and model comparison have also been performed for each subgroup of data (first/second session; tones/syllables) and are presented in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</a>. To try better differentiate communicability with the other models, we recomputed the same correlation analysis but restricted to conditions where communicability makes qualitatively different predictions (<i>new within</i> vs <i>familiar between</i> transitions in the sparse and high sparse designs). By doing so, we reduced most of the correlation between models and only tested for specific contradictory predictions. We again find that hitting time, FEMM, and Hebbian models are equivalent and better than the other models (see <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</a>).",

Transitions between community nodes are sometimes left out during exposure, allowing tests of generalization to those unseen transitions.

They apply several theoretical and neural models to the data and find a range of matches to the empirical results. The best-fitting models are FEMM (Free-Energy Minimization Model) and Hitting Time, and the authors conclude that the mechanisms of those models may underly the patterns observed in humans.",

However, this effect can arise without there having been any learning: Within a community, stimuli are repeated many times before moving to the next community, which should result in stimulus adaptation. At the transition to a new community, stimuli are observed that have not been repeated as many times as recently, so simple adaptation can serve as a strong parsing cue. The paper that introduced this paradigm (Schapiro et al. 2013) included Hamiltonian paths (where every stimulus is visited exactly once) during the parsing task to avoid this confound, but this paper does not include that condition.",

Even with the large sample, many of the pairwise comparisons shown in the bottom row of Figure 3 are not significant. This raises concerns about whether a detailed test between correlated models is possible based on these data. My understanding is that the authors pooled data across all participants and designs and then did bootstrap resampling for statistical tests. I am concerned that this procedure is inflating the seeming reliability of small differences in the data, and sacrificing the ability to statistically generalize to the population. This particular dataset does not seem likely to allow reliable model comparison, at least between the top four or five models here, which are highly correlated.",

Predictions of 7 different models are outlined and correlated with the human forced-choice data. The main result is that learners show a bias in their representation of local transitions, making them sensitive to the high-order structure that characterizes the environment. This result is in line with previous findings in a different behavioral task and with the predictions of models that implement an accuracy-complexity trade-off.",

If the authors want to say that information is lost during memory encoding, I think that is an unnecessary point to make since it is uniformly agreed on. If the authors want to bring in concepts from information theory about compression, I think they need to be more precise since the type of compression they presumably mean is lossy compression (i.e., information is lost), but compression can be lossless (i.e., information is retained but reformatted).

If they did that, I suspect this model would not excel because it assumes that participants treat the edge nodes the same as the non-edge nodes. From multiple studies published using this community structure design, edge nodes are treated differently. Hence, if I were to speculate on a 'compressed representation' that the participants might have, I would assume they have four chunks: a pair of edge nodes and non-edge nodes for each cluster.",

In doing so, they would need to revise their section \"A general model of sequence learning\" where they imply that the FEMM captures the entire learning process, instead of a portion. Moreover, they should be clear about what portion of the learning process they think FEMM accounts for: their normative claims about the value of overgeneralization suggest early stages of learning, but their exclusion of the first epoch suggests they are not testing early learning.

Indeed, as a node can be visited only once at each passage in the community, the predictability of the next element increases as the journey goes on until a perfect predictability for the last element and for the transition to the other community (after having visited the 5th element of the community, the last one is perfectly predictable as well as the change of community) This would lead to periodic predictions of ngrams (cf. the model presented in <a href=\"#sa2fig1\">Author response image 1</a>) whereas a random walk keeps the prediction flat. Only a random walk, therefore, allows for rigorously disentangling a local TP (or ngrams) calculation from higher order calculations such as FEMM or Hitting Time.",

My understanding is that the authors pooled data across all participants and designs and then did bootstrap resampling for statistical tests.

Subjects' performance on the first test after syllable streams was not consistent with any of the models (nor between paradigms), contrary to the other 3 datapoints which are also consistent with themselves.

Indeed, because each participant participates in only one of the paradigms (to avoid contamination of the learned structure to the next paradigm), there is no way to compare overall changes in familiarity between experiments. We therefore only sought to compare the estimate of familiarity within an experimental paradigm. For this reason, all models were also normalized relative to their familiar within community value before being concatenated for correlation (ModelValuesForCorrelation = ModelValues/FamiliarWithinCommunityValue). After normalization, all models estimates for the familiar within-community transitions was 1 for each of the three paradigms, thus not unfairly penalizing any model in the comparison with the data. To not include this value in the correlation would be to ignore the crucial information that the familiarity ranking of other transitions was actually lower than chance (&lt;50%) in each paradigm.",

As mentioned above, transition between syllables are constrained in speech and it is very likely that adults have internalized the transition matrix corresponding to their native language and first tried to apply this model to new data rather than rebuilding an entire model. Moreover in the daily life, sequences of syllables correspond to a succession of words, biasing participants to search for stable syllable transitions which were not present in the stream. Although we had no formal discussion with participants, some pilots/participants also reported that they were looking for familiar words hidden in a nonsense noisy sequence. These priors might explain the harder task in the case of syllables and that participants need some time before changing strategy and learn the real structure of the sequences.",

To start, the authors state in their abstract that \"the brain does not rely on exact memories but compressed representations of the world\". However, I am not sure how the results of this study contribute to our understanding of compression in memory. If the authors want to say that information is lost during memory encoding, I think that is an unnecessary point to make since it is uniformly agreed on. If the authors want to bring in concepts from information theory about compression, I think they need to be more precise since the type of compression they presumably mean is lossy compression (i.e., information is lost), but compression can be lossless (i.e., information is retained but reformatted). In fact, based on how the authors use this term elsewhere, I think chunking might be a better concept to refer to than compression.",

This is peculiar because the authors could have treated this hypothesis as one of the models that they used to try to account for the participants' data. If they did that, I suspect this model would not excel because it assumes that participants treat the edge nodes the same as the non-edge nodes. From multiple studies published using this community structure design, edge nodes are treated differently. Hence, if I were to speculate on a 'compressed representation' that the participants might have, I would assume they have four chunks: a pair of edge nodes and non-edge nodes for each cluster.",

This part might elicit more interference from prior knowledge on the correctness of isolated segment (which in the case of syllables are close to words). Indeed, several experiments have shown how the native language affects statistical learning in adults (Elazar et al., 2022; Onnis and Thiessen, 2013; Siegelman et al., 2018). We modeled the dynamics of learning with FEMM in the presence and absence of priors (see the figure below). Moreover, in the case of syllables, human adults know a priori that syllables form words with a fixed order of syllables. In our experiment, the borders are between communities and, within communities, the elements appear randomly. In other words, language follows a completely different structure than the networks used here, which may hinder the learning of this type of graph when it is formed of syllables. This second type of prior is more difficult to model.",

Thus, further research is needed to address this point. Note that we used syllables because we wanted to test preverbal infants on a similar stream (see our work on statistical learning in neonates (Benjamin et al., 2022; Flo et al., 2022)). Infants respond better to speech stimuli than to non-speech stimuli, probably due to attentional biases and/or neural network dedicated to speech processing. Furthermore, they have not accumulated enough evidence about their native language to have strong priors at the age we test.We are now more cautious in the text about what we can and cannot conclude from these results and have added a paragraph in the methodological remarks section to explicitly state that it is a limitation of the study.

Then we computed the two metrics and the correlation between FEMM and HT predictions. The distribution of the correlations is plotted in <a href=\"#sa2fig7\">Author response image 7</a>.",

TP, FEMM, and Hitting Time matrices are shown below. We can see that the difference between FEMM and Hitting Time is almost entirely driven by the value at position [11,9], due to a single possible transition from node 11 to node 9 with a transition probability of 1 (hitting time is thus equal to 1, which is much larger than for all other transitions). After removing this outlier transition, the correlation rises to 96%. This is the case (at different degrees) for all graphs we could find with a correlation below 80%, suggesting that the difference between the models is restricted to “aberrant” cases in which a transition with a transition probability of 1 is present and driven by it, and thus does not apply to the general case.Thus, we believe that FEMM, hitting time and Hebbian learning are similar models, capturing the same properties of transitions in a network. We included the three in the paper because they refer to different formalisms. FEMM is more accurate and uses a β parameter that could account for possible differences between ages and populations. Hitting Time is easier to understand if one thinks in terms of sequences rather than statistics and networks. Hebbian learning is just a proposed implementation of FEMM with already described Hebb’s rule (different levels in Marr’s classification). There may be some formalism for differentiating FEMM from Hitting Time, but networks do not seem well suited for this purpose, as they almost always give similar predictions in both models.",
