This continuous development, while essential, has contributed to an over-saturation of new, incompatible tools that hinders rigorous benchmarking and complicates reproducible analysis. To address these limitations, we developed SpikeInterface, a Python framework designed to unify preexisting spike sorting technologies into a single codebase and to facilitate straightforward comparison and adoption of different approaches. With a few lines of code, researchers can reproducibly run, compare, and benchmark most modern spike sorting algorithms; pre-process, post-process, and visualize extracellular datasets; validate, curate, and export sorting outputs; and more. In this paper, we provide an overview of SpikeInterface and, with applications to real and simulated datasets, demonstrate how it can be utilized to reduce the burden of manual curation and to more comprehensively benchmark automated spike sorters.",

This continuous development, while essential, has contributed to an over-saturation of new, incompatible tools that hinders rigorous benchmarking and complicates reproducible analysis. To address these limitations, we developed SpikeInterface, a Python framework designed to unify preexisting spike sorting technologies into a single codebase and to facilitate straightforward comparison and adoption of different approaches. With a few lines of code, researchers can reproducibly run, compare, and benchmark most modern spike sorting algorithms; pre-process, post-process, and visualize extracellular datasets; validate, curate, and export sorting outputs; and more. In this paper, we provide an overview of SpikeInterface and, with applications to real and simulated datasets, demonstrate how it can be utilized to reduce the burden of manual curation and to more comprehensively benchmark automated spike sorters.",

When analyzing extracellular recordings, most researchers are interested in the spiking activity of individual neurons, which must be extracted from the raw voltage traces through a process called <i>spike sorting</i>. Many laboratories perform spike sorting using fully manual techniques (e.g. XClust [<a href=\"#bib56\">Mucha, 1995</a>], SimpleClust [<a href=\"#bib81\">Voigts, 2012</a>], Plexon Offline Sorter [<a href=\"#bib66\">Plexon, 2020</a>]), but such approaches are nearly impossible to standardize due to inherent operator bias (<a href=\"#bib82\">Wood et al., 2004</a>). To alleviate this issue, spike sorting has seen decades of algorithmic and software improvements to increase both the accuracy and automation of the process (<a href=\"#bib69\">Rey et al., 2015</a>). This progress has accelerated in the past few years as high-density devices (<a href=\"#bib26\">Eversmann et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Berdondini et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Frey et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Ballini et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">M√ºller et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Yuan et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Lopez et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Jun et al., 2017a</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Dimitriadis et al., 2018</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Angotzi et al., 2019</a>), capable of recording from hundreds to thousands of neurons simultaneously have made manual intervention impractical, increasing the demand for both accurate and scalable spike sorting algorithms (<a href=\"#bib71\">Rossant et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Pachitariu et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Lee et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Chung et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Yger et al., 2018</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Hilgen et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Jun et al., 2017b</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Diggelmann et al., 2018</a>).",

Research labs that are beginning to experiment with high-density extracellular recordings have to choose from a multitude of spike sorters, data processing algorithms, file formats, and curation tools just to analyze their first recording. As trying out multiple spike sorting pipelines is time-consuming and technically challenging, many labs choose one and stick to it as their de facto solution (<a href=\"#bib47\">Magland et al., 2020</a>). This has led to a fragmented software ecosystem which challenges reproducibility, benchmarking, and collaboration among different research labs.",

While useful tools in their own right, these frameworks only implement a limited suite of spike sorting technologies since their main focus is to provide <i>entire</i> extracellular analysis pipelines (spike trains, LFPs, EEG, and more). Moreover, these tools do little to improve the evaluation and comparison of spike sorting performance which is still a relatively unsolved problem in electrophysiology. An exception to this is SpikeForest (<a href=\"#bib47\">Magland et al., 2020</a>), a recently developed open-source software suite that benchmarks 10 automated spike sorting algorithms against an extensive database of ground-truth recordings (SpikeForest makes use of SpikeInterface in many of its core capabilities [file IO, preprocessing, spike sorting]).

The recording has 246 active recording channels (the remaining of the 384 Neuropixels channels were either not inserted in the brain tissue or had a firing rate below 0.1 Hz), and a sampling frequency of 30 kHz. The recording‚Äôs duration was trimmed to 15 min. The probe records from part of the cortex (V1), the hippocampus (CA1), the dentate gyrus, and the thalamus (LP). During the experiment, the mouse was presented with a variety of visual stimuli while freely running on a rotating disk (for more details see <a href=\"#bib78\">Siegle et al., 2019a</a>).

This plot, interestingly, may shed some light on the remarkable accuracy of Kilosort2. While Kilosort2 has the most well-detected units (245), this comes at the cost of a high percentage of false positive (147) and redundant (21) units (The high-rate of false positive/redundant units persists, but is alleviated, even when using Kilosort2‚Äôs automated curation step which removes units that have &gt;20% estimated contamination rate [computed from the refractory period violationsÔªø]. In that case the number of well-detected units is 241, false positives are 93, and redundant units are 18. In both cases two overmerged units are found). Notably, Tridesclous detects very few false positive/redundant units while still finding many well-detected units. HDSort, on the flip side, finds many more false positive units than any other spike sorter.

However, the fraction of true positives in the ensemble (at least two sorters agree) can be significantly lower when only pairs of sorters are used. This is explained by the fact that, for this dataset, a fraction of true positive units are only found by one sorter (as expected since the quality of detection and isolation of the units varies among sorters). In contrast, using four or more sorters reliably identifies most true positive units.

In <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, bar plots for each sorter show the number of matched ground-truth units (blue) and false positive units (red) in relation to the ensemble agreement (1 - no agreement, 6 - full agreement). The plots show that (almost) all false positive units are ones that are found by only a single sorter (not matched with any other sorters), while most real units are matched by more than one sorter. We also assessed how well false positive units can be identified using fewer sorters (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3‚Äîfigure supplement 1</a>). This analysis showed that using a pair of sorters is sufficient to isolate almost all false positive units in each sorter, yet when fewer than four sorter outputs are compared, a significant fraction of true positive units found by only one sorter can be wrongly classified as false positives with this approach. For two sorters, the most reliable identification of true positives for this dataset was achieved by combining Kilosort2 and Ironclust (96% and 95% false positive and true positive detection rate, respectively). In <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, we display the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a function of the ensemble agreement. This shows, as expected, that higher SNR units have higher agreement among sorters. In other words, units with a large amplitude (high SNR) are easier to detect and more consistently found by many sorters. Additionally, we tested if SNR can be used to distinguish between false and true positive units, as noise may be wrongly detected as events with low SNR. We found that for Kilosort2‚Äôs output, which is best matched with ground-truth spike trains, SNR is not a good predictor of false positives (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3‚Äîfigure supplement 2</a>) - many false positives had a high estimated SNR. Taken together, these results suggest that the ensemble agreement among multiple sorters can be used to remove false positive units from each of the sorter outputs or to inform their subsequent manual curation.",

Based on the matching results and the scores, the units of the sorting output are classified as <i>well-detected</i>, <i>false positive</i>, <i>redundant</i>, and <i>overmerged</i>. Well-detected units are matched units with an agreement score above 0.8. False positive units are unmatched units or units which are matched with an agreement score below 0.2. Redundant units have agreement scores above 0.2 with only one ground-truth unit, but are not the best matched tested units (redundant units can either be oversplit or duplicate units). Overmerged units have an agreement score above 0.2 with two or more ground-truth units. All these agreement score thresholds are adjustable by the user. We highlight to the reader that the unit classification proposed here is currently only based on agreement score (i.e. accuracy). More sophisticated classification rules could involve a combination of accuracy, precision, and recall values, which can be easily computed for each unit with the <span class=\"monospace\">spikecomparison</span> module.",

To highlight the modular design of SpikeInterface, we then provided descriptions and code samples for each of the five main packages and showed how they could be chained together to construct flexible spike sorting workflows.",

To identify true neurons and remove poorly sorted and noisy units, we combined the output of several spike sorters and found that although agreement between sorters is generally poor, units that are found by more than one sorter are likely true positives. This strategy, which we term consensus-based or ensemble spike sorting (a terminology borrowed from machine learning; <a href=\"#bib21\">Dietterich, 2000</a>) appears to be a viable alternative to manual curation which suffers from high-variability among different operators (<a href=\"#bib82\">Wood et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Rossant et al., 2016</a>).

A first possibility is to choose a suitable spike sorter (for instance, based on the extensive ground-truth comparison performed by SpikeForest; <a href=\"#bib47\">Magland et al., 2020</a>) and then to curate its output by retaining the units that are in agreement with other sorters. Alternatively, a more conservative approach is to simply record the agreement scores for all sorted units and then <i>hand-curate</i> only those units that have low agreement. A third method, already implemented in SpikeInterface, is to generate a consensus spike sorting by using, for each unit, the union of the two closest matching units from different sorters (matching spikes are only considered once). Although more work is needed to quantitatively assess the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, our analysis indicates that agreement among sorters can be a useful tool for curating sorting results.",

One popular curation method is to accept or reject sorted units based on a variety of quality metrics (this is supported by SpikeInterface). Another method that is gaining more popularity is to use the large amount of available curated datasets to train classifiers that can automatically flag a unit as ‚Äògood‚Äô or ‚Äònoise‚Äô depending on some features, such as waveform shape. Finally, while manual curation is subjective and time consuming, it is the only method that allows for merging and splitting of units and, through powerful software tools such as Phy (<a href=\"#bib70\">Rossant et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Rossant et al., 2016</a>), it allows for full control over the curation process.

In this case, though, reviewers agreed that the work needs a number of major revisions that constitute a substantial amount of work in order to make a major impact across a broad range of readers (e.g., reviewers were not confident that this tool is ready to be used by anyone who is recording with Neuropixels). If you agree with the reviewers that major changes to the tool are necessary to make a major impact on the field, then we would encourage you to submit a majorly revised manuscript to us in the future, citing this manuscript number and requesting the same editor.

Given the lack of real ground truth available for results comparison, this was viewed as a major weakness.

Using the default parameters could lead to suboptimal results, and the authors did not attempt to adjust parameters. Reviewers felt that the SpikeInterface toolbox could also be used to compare results of the same spike sorter using different parameters and that this would be useful to find optimal parameters and would increase the potential impact of this tool.",

While I agree that spike sorting is a hard problem and users need to be helped as much as possible, I don't think this framework helps a lot and will ultimately not find much use. I think Phy (already published and widely used) does most of the work that the authors suggest SpikeInterface should do, and in fact the main use case for SpikeInterface seems to be as an exporter to Phy. At its core, the code provided here is a set of file converters and code wrappers that further obfuscate the black-boxes that many spike sorters are, and make it more difficult for users to know how to build a successful spike sorting pipeline for their own data.",

The authors should make explicit the assumptions that are made in spikeinterface regarding the data that is accepted (e.g. datasets with only waveform snippets appear not to be supported) and the minimal requirement for spike sorters (e.g. do spike sorters need to include their own spike detection algorithm and spike feature extraction?).",

This will improve the understanding of the true potential of a spike sorting algorithm, when comparing it to others in a ground-truth study. As a bare minimum, the authors should discuss the need of a post-sorting split/merge curation step and discuss the effect of leaving the step out on their results. Without such discussion, it would be premature to talk about a \"consensus-based strategy\" to select clusters (subsection ‚ÄúApplication 1: Comparing Spike Sorters on Neuropixels Data‚Äù).",

In the extremes of no false positives or false negatives, an agreement score of 0.2 could either mean all spikes in a cluster represent 20% of the ground truth spikes (i.e. a clean partial cluster) or it could mean that all ground truth spikes represent 20% of the spikes in a cluster (i.e. a \"dirty\" over-merged cluster).

We agree with the reviewers, however, that the shallowness of these analyses was a major weak point that needed to be addressed. Therefore, in our updated manuscript, we completely re-wrote the Results section. In this new Results section, we explore how combining the output of multiple spike sorters can be used to improve overall spike sorting performance, a method we call ensemble spike sorting. To this end, we first demonstrate that there is surprisingly low agreement among six spike sorters designed for high-count probes on a Neuropixels recording (analysis of other recordings are illustrated in the supplement). Next, we repeat this analysis with a simulated Neuropixels dataset (with known ground truth), finding that the sorter agreement level is comparable to that of real data and that almost all units that are found by only one sorter are actually false positive units. Finally, we ask two experts to manually curate the output of the real Neuropixels dataset (using Phy) and compare the manually curated datasets to a consensus sorting result (units agreed upon by at least two out of the six sorters). We find excellent agreement between the ‚Äúgood‚Äù units found in the manually curated datasets and the consensus sorting results. We believe that this new analysis is much more detailed and comprehensive and provides evidence that using multiple spike sorters can potentially inform (or even replace) the time consuming and subjective manual curation step in extracellular analysis pipelines.",

While I agree that spike sorting is a hard problem and users need to be helped as much as possible, I don't think this framework helps a lot and will ultimately not find much use. I think Phy (already published and widely used) does most of the work that the authors suggest SpikeInterface should do, and in fact the main use case for SpikeInterface seems to be as an exporter to Phy. At its core, the code provided here is a set of file converters and code wrappers that further obfuscate the black-boxes that many spike sorters are, and make it more difficult for users to know how to build a successful spike sorting pipeline for their own data.",

As we show in our updated manuscript, the ability to efficiently run multiple spike sorters and to quickly compare their outputs offers new possibilities for automatic curation and unit annotation to inform manual curation.

While many supported sorters are designed for high-count devices (e.g. IronClust, HerdingSpikes, Kilosort2), we also include sorters which are better suited for low-channel counts (Klusta, Wave-Clus, Mountainsort4).

This will improve the understanding of the true potential of a spike sorting algorithm, when comparing it to others in a ground-truth study. As a bare minimum, the authors should discuss the need of a post-sorting split/merge curation step and discuss the effect of leaving the step out on their results. Without such discussion, it would be premature to talk about a \"consensus-based strategy\" to select clusters (subsection ‚ÄúApplication 1: Comparing Spike Sorters on Neuropixels Data‚Äù).",

However, a low agreement score could result from a high number of false positive detections or a high number of false negative detections (or both), and the interpretation would be different in these cases. In the extremes of no false positives or false negatives, an agreement score of 0.2 could either mean all spikes in a cluster represent 20% of the ground truth spikes (i.e. a clean partial cluster) or it could mean that all ground truth spikes represent 20% of the spikes in a cluster (i.e. a \"dirty\" over-merged cluster).

The results show that already two sorters are sufficient to remove false positives, with little change when more sorters are added.

Therefore, the main benefit of combining multiple sorters is a more reliable identification of true positive units.",

However, we found it difficult to judge if these biases were due to the central algorithm or due to other components of the sorting process.
