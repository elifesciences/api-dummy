However, the analysis used (proportion of ISIs) to identify rhythmic activity is flawed and should be replaced by something more appropriate (see below). What the authors are doing is confounded by firing rate: more active neurons are more likely to have ISIs in higher frequency ranges. Thus, the result reported that higher firing rate neurons have more gamma ISIs is expected based on statistical properties alone. To conclude that this reflects a physiological property of interest, the authors need to use either spike-field measures of phase locking (e.g. Bokil et al. J Neurosci 2010) or compare the observed ISI distribution in specific bands to that obtained from a firing rate matched Poisson process (see e.g. Kass et al. Analysis of Neural data book)."

I realize this method is commonplace when you want to make a statement about dSPNs vs iMSNs and have no reason to think anything is changing in FSIs, CINs etc. But in this study we are provided explicit evidence that there are systematic changes happening in FSIs, so there is going to be a clear bias in a measurement that has those in the pool."

I now understand that this is in fact consistent with the mechanism the authors are proposing, but was confused by their use of the term \"off-target\" which to me seemed to imply that they wanted to verify that their stim affected only FSIs and not SPNs directly – which would be useful to test under synaptic blockage conditions, but that isn't what they actually do.

They argue that FSIs undergo plastic changes during habit formation, and influence a subset of SPNs to promote the expression of habitual behavior. I am generally enthusiastic about this study.

Concretely, naive slices contain SPN responses that have a distribution of amplitudes (1D) and slices from habitual animals have a large-amplitude, indirect-SPN-delay biased responses. How, exactly, do the authors envision FSI recruitment (or lack thereof) during habit formation or goal directed behaviors shape the naive SPN responses into what is cartoonishly depicted in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>.

Is it the case that goal-directed mice in RI group (excluded dots at bottom) exhibited physiological characteristics that were similar to RR group, or alternatively naive mice?

As before, I am enthusiastic about the integrative approach taken by the authors in combining and synthesizing across multiple experimental approaches. However, I detect an overall tendency to constrain the interpretation of specific experiments by referring to an overall synthesis or working model derived from multiple experiments. As I elaborate on below, for me to have more confidence in the results, I expect the authors to first carefully interpret the results from specific individual experiments in the Results section, without reference to an overall favored working model. Then, they are encouraged (in the Discussion) to come up with a synthesis across experiments. What I think they should avoid is writing parts of the results as if this synthesis has already been shown to be correct. This overall issue is illustrated below, particularly in my response to points 3a and 3b."

The fact that vehicle/CNO treatments were given on separate days and counterbalanced for order is important information that should be included in the Materials and methods, ideally with the table shown in the rebuttal, so that readers can see that in some cases, there were 10+ weeks between the two experiment days."

My point here is quite simple: what is the evidence that relative gamma ISI density, rather than firing rate, is the relevant variable here? In the rebuttal, the authors provide a figure showing a lack of significant correlation between firing rate and the fraction of gamma-band ISIs. But this does not exclude the possibility that if the new <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a> would test for a correlation between firing rate (fold change; the quantity plotted on the vertical axis) and baseline firing rate instead of gamma density, the reported correlation would persist. I agree with the points made by the authors that it's entirely possible that low overall firing rates are responsible for the lack of a significant correlation between firing rate and the fraction of gamma-band ISIs, and the Poisson analysis is interesting in its own right (my original suggestion would require a further step: asking if the excess gamma ISI probability predicts firing rate change following CNO). However, these are all indirect points. The most direct way of testing whether invoking gamma ISI density is necessary is to determine if using baseline firing rate yields the same overall result or not. If so, I don't see the need for a more complicated, gamma-ISI related explanation. In the rebuttal, the authors state, \"fold change correlated with gamma density, not the rate itself\" but I did not see evidence for the latter claim in the manuscript: this needs to be tested and stated explicitly."

However, I believe the authors' suggestion that their work is the first to show an effect of DLS manipulation on the expression (rather than acquisition) of habits is overstated. Packard and McGaugh (1996) performed lidocaine injections in the caudate nucleus following acquisition of a response strategy on a plus maze. Post-training baclofen/muscimol infusions into the DLS reduce habitual lever-pressing for alcohol (2012 Biol Psychiatry, 2016 Frontiers Behav Neuro), and has similar effects on lever pressing for cocaine (Zapata et al. J Neurosci 2010). Thus, for different operationalizations of habit and reinforcer, post-training manipulations of DLS have been shown to affect habitual (but not goal-directed) behavior."

But in this case it's hard to see beyond the most direct way to rule out nonspecific changes related to time, which is simply to counterbalance the order of the treatment and control groups, or to collect washout data. The authors second observation provided is the most relevant in that it does contain a treatment vs. control comparison without the potential time confound, but this is a separate experiment, but low n, where we are not told how its timescale maps on to the main experiment, while leaving open whether the effect shown here underlies the full <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> results. The other observations are more indirect still. Fixing this would require re-doing the experiment.

I do not think it is appropriate to take their proposed overall mechanism and use it as a source of top-down constraints on the initial interpretation of specific, individual experiments. What I want to see is careful descriptions and conclusions for each individual experiment in the Results that appropriately take the limitations of each into account.

However, pre-CNO firing rate is a numerically better predictor of such changes than excess gamma-band ISIs (r = -0.61 vs -0.45), casting doubt on the relevance of this feature given that a simpler and more predictive measure is available. The authors argue that firing rate \"non-specifically\" predicts such changes (i.e. for both vehicle and CNO) and that therefore excess gamma-band ISIs (which only predict post-CNO firing rates, but not post-vehicle rates) is an interesting quantity; however, these results could also be interpreted to mean that gamma-band ISIs is simply a worse predictor overall. I could imagine additional analyses, such as a multiple regression, that could help clarify this issue; however, regardless of the specific outcome, any remaining variance explained will likely be low and of unclear relevance. In addition, the authors should be aware that a comparison between two t-tests (one significant, one non-significant) does not constitute sufficient evidence for an interaction (see Nieuwenhuis et al.

First, CINs and some FSIs get excluded <i>a priori</i> from analysis based on size exclusion criteria we set up in developing the imaging approach initially (O’Hare et al., 2016). In that development phase, we used reporter cell lines to define properties of non‐SPNs and developed exclusion criteria to limit their contamination of the data set. This size criterion is noted in the current manuscript’s Materials and methods section. Second, even without any exclusion criteria, FSIs comprise only 1% of the striatal neurons, therefore, even in the most optimistic setting, the data would have to derive from at most 2‐3 cells among the 52 imaged cells that generated the observation. Such a minor fraction of cells is insufficient to generate the correlations we find (see for example <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Moreover, if the affected cells were FSIs, they should partition unequally between SPN types, predominantly in the “nonDrd1a” iSPN group (see Ade et al., Frontiers Neurosci. 2011), and this is also not the case (e.g. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Third, subsequent electrophysiological experiments in SPNs confirmed by their electrophysiological signatures also show the finding, and in both SPN subgroups (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</a>)."

Firstly, absolute values are influenced by electrode position in the brain slice relative to the imaged area, whereas the difference between two populations distributed about the same electrode bypasses that concern. Secondly, the absolute latency values include the superimposition of not only distance from electrode to soma, but also kinetics of calcium dye transients, and time differences related to the location of the cell along the line scan vector. Since all of these factors are consistent between the test and control conditions, significant differences in relative latency can be observed, it is just that the absolute values are of a bit less importance. Nonetheless, we are happy to provide values closer to the primary data and thank you for your interest."

These results were surprising for two reasons. First, rather than a blockade of FSI activity causing disinhibition of SPNs as we had hypothesized, we found that when FSI activity was reduced, SPN activity was also reduced. This result suggests that FSI activity is capable of promoting, rather than inhibiting, SPN activity at least in the acute brain slice preparation. Secondly, although IEM-1460 strikingly affected the same features of DLS output that predict the expression of habitual behavior (calcium transient amplitude in both pathways and relative pathway timing) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), the directionality of these effects was opposite in all measures. Therefore, these results revise the overall hypothesis to involve a gain, rather than loss, of FSI activity as a candidate mechanism for habitual behavior.”"

My point here is quite simple: what is the evidence that relative gamma ISI density, rather than firing rate, is the relevant variable here? In the rebuttal, the authors provide a figure showing a lack of significant correlation between firing rate and the fraction of gamma-band ISIs. But this does not exclude the possibility that if the new <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a> would test for a correlation between firing rate (fold change; the quantity plotted on the vertical axis) and baseline firing rate instead of gamma density, the reported correlation would persist. I agree with the points made by the authors that it's entirely possible that low overall firing rates are responsible for the lack of a significant correlation between firing rate and the fraction of gamma-band ISIs, and the Poisson analysis is interesting in its own right (my original suggestion would require a further step: asking if the excess gamma ISI probability predicts firing rate change following CNO). However, these are all indirect points. The most direct way of testing whether invoking gamma ISI density is necessary is to determine if using baseline firing rate yields the same overall result or not. If so, I don't see the need for a more complicated, gamma-ISI related explanation. In the rebuttal, the authors state, \"fold change correlated with gamma density, not the rate itself\" but I did not see evidence for the latter claim in the manuscript: this needs to be tested and stated explicitly.</i>"

The authors argue that firing rate \"non-specifically\" predicts such changes (i.e. for both vehicle and CNO) and that therefore excess gamma-band ISIs (which only predict post-CNO firing rates, but not post-vehicle rates) is an interesting quantity; however, these results could also be interpreted to mean that gamma-band ISIs is simply a worse predictor overall. I could imagine additional analyses, such as a multiple regression, that could help clarify this issue; however, regardless of the specific outcome, any remaining variance explained will likely be low and of unclear relevance. In addition, the authors should be aware that a comparison between two t-tests (one significant, one non-significant) does not constitute sufficient evidence for an interaction (see Nieuwenhuis et al.

FSIs comprise approximately 1% of all striatal neurons and are not present in the Drd1a-TdTomato labelled population. However, FSIs might be included in the “putative iSPN” population. Empiric experiments using Pv-Cre x Ai9 reporter mice demonstrate that approximately 50% of FSIs are labelled with Fura2-AM and pass data inclusion criteria in our experimental setting (see Materials and methods and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore, we expect at most that approximately 1% of iSPN and none of dSPN data may represent FSIs. Because CIN and FSI firing properties are very different from SPNs, we reviewed our data sets for the presence of outliers using Robust regression and Outlier (ROUT) analysis (GraphPad Prism software) and a false discovery rate of Q = 1%. No outliers were detected in iSPN baseline amplitude, post-IEM-1460 amplitude, or latency modulation datasets of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>.”"

Behavioral neuroscientists refer to habits as “stimulus-response” behaviors, and know that forming a new habit requires a region deep within the brain called the dorsolateral striatum. Indeed, in this region, the outgoing neurons – which make up 95% of the cells - respond differently to incoming signals in mice that have learned habits compared to non-habitual mice.

These findings were made using mice that had been trained to press a lever for a sugar pellet reward. Habit was measured by how long mice kept pressing even if they had just been allowed to eat their fill of pellets and the test lever was no longer dispensing pellets.

Further work is needed before such treatments might become available to treat habit-related disorders; though O'Hare et al. are now taking steps in this direction by trying to work out how the fast-spiking interneuron changes its own activity when a habit is formed."

Habitual behavior correlates with broad reconfigurations of dorsolateral striatal (DLS) circuit properties that increase gain and shift pathway timing. The mechanism(s) for these circuit adaptations are unknown and could be responsible for habitual behavior. Here we find that a single class of interneuron, fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs), modulates all of these habit-predictive properties. Consistent with a role in habits, FSIs are more excitable in habitual mice compared to goal-directed and acute chemogenetic inhibition of FSIs in DLS prevents the expression of habitual lever pressing. <i>In vivo</i> recordings further reveal a previously unappreciated selective modulation of SPNs based on their firing patterns; FSIs inhibit most SPNs but paradoxically promote the activity of a subset displaying high fractions of gamma-frequency spiking. These results establish a microcircuit mechanism for habits and provide a new example of how interneurons mediate experience-dependent behavior."

Once established, habits allow routine actions to be triggered by external cues. This automation frees cognitive resources that would otherwise process action-outcome relationships underlying goal-directed behavior. The dorsolateral region of the striatum has been heavily implicated in the formation and expression of habits through lesion and inactivation studies (<a href=\"#bib61\">Yin et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Yin et al., 2006</a>), <i>in vivo</i> recordings (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Jog et al., 1999</a>), and changes in synaptic strength (<a href=\"#bib47\">Shan et al., 2015</a>). More recently, properties of the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) input-output transformation of afferent activity to striatal projection neuron firing were found to predict the extent of habitual behavior in individual animals (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>). Despite these observations, the cellular microcircuit mechanisms driving habitual behavior have not been identified."

The properties of evoked SPN firing <i>ex vivo</i> linearly predict behavior across the goal-directed to habitual spectrum in an operant lever pressing task (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>). Specifically, habitual responding correlates with larger evoked responses in both the direct and indirect pathways as well as a shorter latency to fire of dSPNs relative to iSPNs. To identify a microcircuit mechanism for habitual behavior, we manipulated the striatal microcircuitry to identify local circuit elements that modulated these habit-predictive SPN firing properties (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>)."

(<b>D</b>) Left: Representative SPN calcium transient waveforms before and after wash-in of IEM-1460. SPNs were grouped into ‘high-firing’ (red) or ‘low-firing’ (blue) clusters based solely on their baseline response amplitudes using a Gaussian mixture model. SPNs with strong baseline responses (red, ‘high firing’) show weaker responses after wash-in whereas those with initially weak responses (blue, ‘low firing’) are unaffected. Right: Evoked calcium transient amplitudes for all imaged SPNs before (-) and after (+) wash-in of IEM-1460. For both cell types, high-firing SPNs showed decreased responses after IEM-1460 wash-in (dSPNs: t(22) = 6.43, p=0.0000018, n = 23 cells; iSPNs: t(17) = 3.43, p=0.0032, n = 18 cells) whereas low-firing SPNs did not (dSPNs: p=0.24, n = 64 cells; iSPNs: p=0.21, n = 34 cells). (<b>E</b>) Linear regression and correlational analyses show that the inhibitory effect of IEM-1460 on SPN responses (post – baseline difference) is a linear function of baseline response amplitudes for both dSPNs (red; r(86) = −0.87, p=2.20×10<sup>−28</sup>, n = 87 cells) and iSPNs (green; r(51) = −0.80, p=1.59×10<sup>−12</sup>, n = 52 cells). (<b>F</b>) Relative pathway timing, as measured by latency to peak detection, before and after inhibition of FSIs using IEM-1460. Indirect pathway activation precedes direct pathway activation by a greater margin after wash-in of IEM-1460 (t(102) = 2.42, p=0.017, n = 52 independent dSPN/iSPN pairs). *p&lt;0.05.

In addition, within the DLS, habit-predictive SPN firing properties were distributed uniformly rather than in discrete subpopulations of SPNs (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>). Because interneurons are often anatomically suited to tune SPN activity in a similarly broad manner through extensive axonal arbors (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kawaguchi et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Tepper et al., 2010</a>), we hypothesized that plasticity of striatal interneurons might underlie the habit-associated changes in striatal output."

Notably, FSIs are expressed in the dorsal striatum on a mediolateral gradient with the most residing in DLS (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gerfen, 1985</a>). FSIs also preferentially innervate dSPNs relative to iSPNs (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gittis et al., 2010</a>), suggesting a potential mechanism by which FSI-mediated inhibition could allow iSPNs to fire before dSPNs in response to coincident excitatory input. Based on these considerations, we hypothesized that FSIs might drive the habit-predictive circuit features through a disinhibitory mechanism that would promote SPN firing and a preferentially earlier activation of the direct pathway. Striatal FSI plasticity has been demonstrated through experimenter-induced activity and genetic manipulations (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mathur et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Winters et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Orduz et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gittis et al., 2011a</a>), but it remains unknown whether dorsal striatal FSIs undergo plasticity normally in the context of experience-dependent adaptive behavior."

Surprisingly though, silencing FSIs produced the opposite directionality for each habit-predictive circuit feature, suggesting that an increase, rather than decrease, in FSI activity might drive habitual behavior. Indeed, when FSI firing was evoked <i>ex vivo</i> by stimulation of cortical afferents, FSIs from habitual mice fired more readily than FSIs from goal-directed mice. To test the significance of this plasticity for the expression of habitual behavior, we acutely inhibited FSIs in DLS chemogenetically. Inhibiting FSIs in habit-trained mice blocked habit expression, but not lever-pressing per se, while identically-trained control subjects displayed robust habitual behavior. <i>In vivo</i> recordings revealed that the effects of FSI activity on striatal output appear to be more selective than previously appreciated. While FSIs exert the expected strongly inhibitory influence over DLS output, they also promote activity in a subset of SPNs that can be identified <i>a priori</i> based upon individual SPN firing patterns. Our results identify a mechanism for habit by which FSI strengthening reconfigures DLS output and promotes the expression of habitual behavior."

Striatal FSIs express AMPARs lacking the GluA2 subunit, rendering them permeable to calcium (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hollmann et al., 1991</a>), whereas SPNs do not typically express CP-AMPARs. Consistent with this difference in AMPAR subunit expression, IEM-1460 does not affect excitatory synaptic currents in SPNs but strongly decreases excitatory transmission onto FSIs (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gittis et al., 2011b</a>). Cell-attached FSI recordings before and after exposure to IEM-1460 (50 μM) confirmed the drug’s efficacy to reduce synaptically-evoked AP firing in our acute parasagittal DLS preparation (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</a>). To first approximate how FSIs modulate the habit-predictive properties of evoked striatal output, the same <i>ex vivo</i> population calcium imaging approach that identified the behavior-predictive properties (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>) was used on tissue prepared from untrained animals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). Firing responses evoked by electrical activation of cortical afferents were measured in dozens of pathway-defined SPNs of both types simultaneously using the calcium indicator dye fura-2AM, the <i>Drd1a</i>-tdTomato (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ade et al., 2011</a>) reporter, and vector-mode two-photon laser scanning microscopy (2PLSM) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; see Materials and methods and <a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>). Action potential responses were detected by cross-correlation analysis with a template waveform that was obtained from single-action potential responses during simultaneous cell-attached electrophysiological recordings for each SPN subtype (see Materials and methods). Contamination of dSPN and iSPN datasets by interneurons was minimized by selection criteria and monitoring datasets for outliers (See Materials and methods for further details)."

To determine whether there was selectivity for IEM-1460’s effects on SPNs with large basal responses, calcium transient amplitude was used as a feature to classify SPNs as having large or small evoked calcium transients prior to drug wash-in. Rather than specifying an arbitrary cutoff value for the transient amplitude, we used an unsupervised clustering algorithm known as a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to separate SPNs into two clusters. Based on calibration data in this preparation demonstrating the relationship between calcium transient amplitude and number of action potentials (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>), the GMM separated SPNs into clusters corresponding to multi-action potential (larger transients; ‘high-firing’) and single-action potential (smaller transients; ‘low-firing’) responses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Compared to the use of a physiologically-based 0.05 ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> cutoff value, the unbiased GMM classification was in 90.5% agreement.

This result confirms that IEM-1460, which inhibits FSI firing (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</a>), selectively reduces multi-action potential SPN responses to afferent stimulation as suggested by calcium imaging experiments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>)."

These results were surprising for two reasons. First, rather than a blockade of FSI activity causing disinhibition of SPNs as we had hypothesized, we found that when FSI activity was reduced, SPN activity was also reduced. This result suggests that FSI activity is capable of promoting, rather than inhibiting, SPN activity at least in the acute brain slice preparation. Secondly, although IEM-1460 strikingly affected the same features of DLS output that predict the expression of habitual behavior (calcium transient amplitude in both pathways and relative pathway timing) (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>), the directionality of these effects was opposite in all measures. Therefore, these results revise the overall hypothesis to involve a <i>gain</i>, rather than loss, of FSI activity as a candidate mechanism for habitual behavior."

To isolate the effects of FSIs, the light-activated hyperpolarizing proton pump Archaerhodopsin-3 fused to green fluorescent protein (Arch-GFP) was Cre-dependently expressed in parvalbumin (PV)-expressing cells. <i>Pvalb</i>-Cre mice were crossed to a line which Cre-dependently expressed Arch-GFP (See Materials and methods).

Additionally, Arch expressed in PV+ cells (PV-Arch) abolished high-frequency firing of FSIs in response to somatic current injection (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</a>) and had no effect on SPN firing in the same recording configuration (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</a>)."

In this configuration, PV-Arch effectively blocked evoked FSI firing (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). We found that optical inhibition of PV+ interneurons reliably decreased evoked SPN firing (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, left and middle panels). Given that IEM-1460 selectively reduced the probability of multi-action potential SPN responses, we examined whether optical inhibition of PV+ neurons had a similar selectivity. Analysis of SPN responses by trial (paired consecutive laser OFF/ON sweeps), rather than by cell, indicated that single-action potential events and failures were unaffected when FSIs were silenced (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, right panel). Moreover, a single-exponential fit of all trial-by-trial data showed a selective contribution of FSIs to multi-spike SPN responses (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, right panel). Consistent with the IEM-1460 results in 2PLSM calcium imaging (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D–E</a>) and cell-attached recording (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</a>) experiments, this optogenetic result indicates that FSIs promote multi-action potential SPN responses to cortical excitation in the brain slice and that the effects of IEM-1460 on striatal output occur primarily through a reduction of striatal FSI activity."

We measured FSI synaptic and cellular electrophysiological properties in DLS brain slices prepared from habitual and goal-directed mice. <i>Pvalb</i>-Cre mice were bilaterally injected with AAV5-Ef1a-DIO-eYFP in the DLS to label PV+ interneurons and subsequently trained on an operant task in which they learned to press a lever for sucrose pellet rewards. Lever presses were reinforced on a random interval (RI) schedule to induce habit formation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dickinson et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hilário et al., 2007</a>) or on an abbreviated random ratio (RRshort) schedule to produce goal-directed behavior (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</a>). Habit was measured by evaluating the sensitivity of the learned lever press behavior to devaluation of the sucrose pellet reward. Goal-directed performance is known to be highly sensitive to outcome devaluation whereas habitual performance is less sensitive (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dickinson et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hilário et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dickinson, 1985</a>). The sucrose pellet reward was devalued by inducing sensory-specific satiety. Specifically, mice were pre-fed with the reward pellets or, as a control for general satiety-related behavioral changes, identically-sized normal grain pellets. On separate but consecutive days, mice were alternately pre-fed 1.3 g of either the sucrose pellet reward (devalued condition) or the grain-only pellet (non-devalued condition), counterbalancing which pre-feed condition was tested first. Lever press rates were then measured during brief 3 min probe tests without reinforcement. Habitual behavior was quantified in individual mice as the log<sub>2</sub> ratio of the devalued versus non-devalued lever press rates (normalized devalued lever press rate; NDLP<sub>r</sub>). RI-trained mice with an NDLP<sub>r</sub> ≥ 0, that is, insensitive to outcome devaluation, were considered to be habitual.

FSIs from habitual mice displayed higher firing rates compared to FSIs from goal-directed mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Action potential kinetics did not appear to explain these group differences in firing rates as action potential waveforms were not appreciably different between groups (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</a>). However, the duration over which firing could be sustained markedly differed between the two behavioral groups (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). The majority of FSIs from goal-directed mice were unable to maintain high-frequency firing for the entire duration of the 500 ms current injection (&lt;250 ms of firing in 10/15 cells) whereas nearly all FSIs from habitual mice maintained such activity (&gt;450 ms firing in 7/9 cells). Interestingly, the distribution of goal-directed FSI response durations was strongly bimodal whereas that of habitual FSI response durations was not (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). The group difference in response durations explained the difference in firing rates between FSIs of habitual and goal-directed mice since, when firing rates were normalized to the duration of firing instead of duration of the current step, there was no longer a group difference in firing rate (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>)."

However, it was afferent activation that initially revealed habit-predictive striatal output properties (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>). Therefore, in order for FSI plasticity to alter striatal output, it must be sufficient to differentially drive FSI firing in response to similar coincident synaptic excitation. FSI firing was monitored in cell-attached mode in response to electrical stimulation of excitatory afferents. We found that FSIs of habitual mice fired more readily than those from mice with goal-directed behavior (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). This habit-related difference in FSI excitability was not readily explained by other aspects of lever pressing performance including the total number of lever presses or rewards delivered over the course of training (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</a>). We noted the apparent bimodal distribution of total rewards delivered for goal-directed subjects (p=0.013, Hartigans’ dip test; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</a>) and wondered if the number of rewards received by an animal was related to the similarly-distributed FSI response durations to current injection (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Instead, we found that response durations from both modes of the distribution were commonly found in FSIs from the same goal-directed mouse (for example, 494.7 and 180.9 ms). Together, these experiments show that FSIs undergo long-lasting, experience-dependent plasticity with habit formation and that this plasticity is sufficient to increase FSI firing."

In acute slice experiments, FSIs had displayed an unexpected and selective effect of promoting multi-action potential responses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1D,E and</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2C</a>) but not otherwise affecting spike probability (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</a>). To assess whether FSIs also promoted activity in identifiable subsets of SPNs <i>in vivo</i>, we analyzed the baseline firing patterns in single SPNs prior to CNO injection. SPN spiking was categorized into discrete frequency bands by deriving instantaneous firing rate from interspike intervals (ISIs) and was then normalized to total number of ISIs for each single unit. This analysis defined the fraction of ISIs corresponding to each frequency band for each SPN and was independent of local field potentials."

Additionally, we found that SPNs fire significantly more gamma-frequency spikes than expected by Poisson processes matched to firing rate (pre-CNO: t(44) = 5.76, p=7.67×10<sup>−7</sup>, n = 23 SPNs and rate-matched simulations; pre-vehicle: t(38) = 8.24, p=5.59×10<sup>−10</sup>, n = 20 SPNs and rate-matched simulations).

Directly comparing correlation coefficients using Fisher r-to-z transformations showed that baseline firing rates did not predict SPN rate modulation by CNO better than by vehicle (z = −0.68, p=0.25) whereas baseline excess gamma specifically predicted modulation by CNO (z = −1.88, p=0.030). Therefore, gamma-frequency spiking represents a feature of interest in SPNs that predicts whether these output neurons will fire more or less as a consequence of reducing FSI activity."

In brain regions other than the striatum, interneuron activity appears to most commonly serve as a gate for the induction of long-lasting plasticity elsewhere in the local circuitry (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kuhlman et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kvitsiani et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wolff et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Yazaki-Sugiyama et al., 2009</a>). Although the potential for FSIs themselves to exhibit long-lasting activity-dependent plasticity is well-documented in acute brain slice experiments (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mathur et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Orduz et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hainmüller et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sarihi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dehorter et al., 2015</a>), we are aware of only one report in which these interneurons were found to undergo experience-dependent plasticity and contribute to the expression of an adaptive behavior or memory (<a href=\"#bib12\">Donato et al., 2013</a>). Here we provide the first such example for striatal interneurons. We find that FSIs are a site of adaptive plasticity that drives circuit and behavioral hallmarks of habit. The habit-associated changes in FSI excitability appear distinct (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</a>) from previously reported plasticity processes which included activity-induced changes in FSI-SPN synapses selectively at direct pathway SPNs (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mathur et al., 2013</a>) and changes in firing rate related to the modulation of afterhyperolarization currents by parvalbumin expression levels (<a href=\"#bib42\">Orduz et al., 2013</a>). Further characterizing the plasticity mechanisms we find in habit represents an important area for future research as it may reveal a useful target for pharmacological modulation of FSI activity."

To do this, we first examined how FSIs influenced striatal output using a pharmacological approach that inhibits excitatory synapses on striatal FSIs (and also CINs). In brain slices from untrained mice, IEM-1460 treatment showed striking specificity in that it modulated all of the previously described (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>) habit-predictive properties of evoked SPN firing <i>ex vivo</i>: gain of dSPN and iSPN responses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>), and the relative timing of firing between dSPNs and iSPNs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>).

FSI inhibition also altered the timing of direct and indirect pathway neuron firing in a direction that opposed the habit circuit signature (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,F</a>) and closely resembled previous observations in lever-press trained, goal-directed mice (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>). This suggests that, in DLS, relative pathway timing is altered with habit formation but not with requisite goal-directed learning. Thus, the modest nature of the timing shift after pharmacological FSI blockade in untrained mice is likely due to a floor effect. Altogether, the observed effects of FSIs on SPNs lead to the prediction that an increase in FSI activity with habit formation would generate the evoked SPN properties that correlate with habit behavior (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>). Accordingly, in habitual mice, we found that FSI firing was increased, and under the same cortical afferent stimulation conditions that evoke habit-predictive SPN firing properties (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). This series of observations leads to a model of the striatal circuit basis for habitual behavior whereby habit formation is accompanied by a long-lasting increase in FSI excitability. In this setting, incoming cortical activity would be predicted to recruit more FSI activity that would in turn drive more firing of SPNs and shift their latencies such that direct pathway SPNs would tend to fire relatively sooner."

Previous pharmacological inactivation studies have demonstrated a role for DLS in habit expression (<a href=\"#bib43\">Packard and McGaugh, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Zapata et al., 2010</a>), indicating that general disruption of DLS activity also impairs established habitual behavior.

In the acute slice, only activity of those SPNs which displayed burst-like, multi-action potential responses to single-pulse stimuli (‘high-firing’ SPNs) was suppressed when FSIs were silenced (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1D,E</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2C</a>). <i>In vivo</i>, the activity of SPNs showing the highest fractions of gamma-frequency spiking was suppressed, instead of disinhibited, when FSI activity was chemogenetically reduced (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). In both cases, the SPNs were distinguished by a higher propensity for burst-like firing patterns. It was further notable that the fraction of SPNs negatively modulated by reduced FSI activity was similar in both preparations (29% <i>ex vivo</i> compared to 26% <i>in vivo</i>). Conversely, we also found that less-active SPNs were not significantly modulated in the slice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1D,E</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2C</a>) and SPNs with less gamma-frequency spiking were disinhibited <i>in vivo</i> when FSI activity was reduced (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>).

While a voltage-dependent excitatory effect of GABA would not necessarily affect spike probability due to a concurrent decrease in membrane resistance and the disparity between E<sub>Cl-</sub> and spike threshold, such an effect could boost the glutamate-driven depolarization of an SPN in its down state (<a href=\"#bib27\">Humphries et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bracci and Panzeri, 2006</a>).

To confer specificity for certain actions, additional circuit dynamics would ostensibly be required. We hypothesized that such specificity could arise from the activation of subsets of task-specific cortical neuron projections that would in turn activate task-specific SPNs (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rothwell et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Carelli and West, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Gremel et al., 2016</a>).

In habits, one possible mechanism then is that task-specific cortical commands drive (<a href=\"#bib50\">Smith et al., 2012</a>), or at least initiate (<a href=\"#bib4\">Berke et al., 2004</a>), high-frequency firing in a cluster/subset of SPNs that would then be preferentially excited by FSIs. Additionally, in such a mechanism, feed-forward inhibition of less-active SPNs (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mallet, 2005</a>) by FSIs might then serve as a selective filter to further enhance signal-to-noise ratio in corticostriatal transmission.

Interestingly, since both of the above studies defined FSIs by parvalbumin immunoreactivity, an intriguing alternative view of those results is that parvalbumin levels are below detection threshold but cell number is not necessarily reduced. Lower parvalbumin levels are associated with a hyperexcitable FSI phenotype (<a href=\"#bib42\">Orduz et al., 2013</a>), which is akin to the direction of FSI plasticity we associate with habit in the present study.

FSIs comprise approximately 1% of all striatal neurons and are not present in the <i>Drd1a</i>-TdTomato labelled population (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ade et al., 2011</a>).

Therefore, we expect at most that approximately 1% of iSPN and none of dSPN data may represent FSIs.

Template waveforms were composite action potentials recorded in cell-attached mode from single neurons that were positively identified as the corresponding cell type in a subsequent whole cell current clamp recording. The dot product representing a perfect fit was obtained by cross-correlating the template peak to itself. If the dot product of the data and the template peak was equal or greater than 25% of this perfect fit, then an action potential was called by a peak detection algorithm (Mathworks, Inc.). Stimulus artifacts and rare spontaneous action potentials were excluded by only analyzing data from 1 to 100 ms (FSIs) or 1–600 ms (SPNs) after stimulus delivery. Due to the sharp FSI cell-attached waveform, electrical noise was matched to the FSI template peak in some recordings. To exclude these false calls, two additional exclusion criteria were added: action potentials were excluded (1) if their amplitudes were less than 10 standard deviations of the recording minus the stimulus artifact, i.e. electrical noise and (2) if their cross-correlation peak amplitudes were less than 25% of the maximum peak in a given sweep."

Action potential onset and offset were defined at the intersections of the waveform with a sliding mean baseline voltage that constituted 10% of the length of the current injection. Action potential and after-hyperpolarization properties were measured up to the point when increasing current injection attenuated firing rate. Action potential half-width was defined as half the time between onset and peak voltage. Action potential amplitude was defined as the voltage difference between the sliding baseline and peak amplitude. AHP potential onset and offset were defined as the next two intersections with the sliding baseline after the action potential peak voltage. AHP amplitude was defined as the negative-most voltage between onset and offset and the AHP waveform was integrated over the sliding baseline for total voltage. AHP voltage measurements were converted to current using input resistance. Firing rates were measured in response to a series of increasing 500 ms current step amplitudes ranging from −0.4 to 2.0 nA in 200 pA intervals. Maximum response duration was defined as the longest period of sustained firing observed during this series of current injections. Rheobase was determined by identifying the 200 pA interval in which the first action potential was fired and subsequently interrogating this interval with 500 ms current injections at 10 pA resolution. Subthreshold test pulses were used to determine passive membrane properties. Input resistance was calculated as R<sub>I</sub> = dV/I. Whole cell capacitance was calculated by integrating the decay phase after current injection to measure discharged current and dividing by voltage of the current injection: ∫V<sub>decay</sub>/IR<sub>i </sub>﻿(<a href=\"#bib19\">Gittis et al., 2010</a>). Series resistance was calculated by fitting a standard double-exponential function to the decay transient and deriving the time constant τ = 1/λ<sub>fast</sub> to find τ<sub>fast</sub> = R<sub>s</sub> x C<sub>whole cell</sub>.

The fraction of ISIs falling in a particular frequency band was calculated relative to the total number of ISIs. To compare frequency band distributions of single unit records to rate-matched Poisson processes, for each single unit with N ISIs, N points were randomly drawn from a Poisson distribution with λ set to the mean ISI (1/mean firing rate) for the corresponding single unit. This simulation was run 20 times per single unit. All 20 simulations were binned according to the described frequency band bounds and normalized counts were averaged across simulations. Since each simulated unit corresponded to a real recording with mean firing rate = 1/λ, observed and simulated data were compared via multiple paired t-tests and Bonferroni-Sidak correction for multiple comparisons. For behavioral analysis, 3D tracking data were transformed into Cartesian coordinates (x, y and z) by the Cortex software (MotionAnalysis Corp.) to allow distance calculations."

Additionally, a lockout window was set in the peak detection algorithm to ensure that no event could occur within 1 s of the previously detected event. For an ROI to be included, a noise threshold was empirically determined to avoid excessive false event detection: the standard deviation of the ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> signal could not equal or exceed 0.0575. Additionally, ROIs were excluded if fluorescence was saturating, if they had drifted from the scan path such that signal was no longer detected, if they did not respond at least once to a supra-threshold stimulus (1.5 mA) delivered 10 times at the end of the experiment, and if the ratio of non-evoked to evoked events detected at this suprathreshold stimulation intensity was greater than 4.5. These parameters were tested against multiple data sets from simultaneous calcium imaging and cell-attached recording experiments as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Hare et al., 2016</a>) and were found to create an optimal balance of minimizing false detections and maximizing correct detections. Finally, slices which displayed poor loading, likely due to poor slice health or experimenter error during bulk-loading, were excluded from analysis. Each slice was required to have at least 12 SPNs of each subtype that passed all other exclusion criteria. This criterion was determined by finding the <i>N</i> at which coefficient of variation (CV) became a linear function of sample size, i.e. decreased only due to the CV denominator and not undersampling."
