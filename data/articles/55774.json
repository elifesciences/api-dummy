Alcids exhibit exceptional dive performance while retaining aerial flight. We hypothesized that alcids maintain efficient Strouhal numbers and stroke velocities across air and water, allowing them to mitigate the costs of their 'fluid generalism'. We show that alcids cruise at Strouhal numbers between 0.10 and 0.40 – on par with single-fluid specialists – in both air and water but flap their wings ~50% slower in water. Thus, these species either contract their muscles at inefficient velocities or maintain a two-geared muscle system, highlighting a clear cost to using the same morphology for locomotion in two fluids. Additionally, alcids varied stroke-plane angle between air and water and chord angle during aquatic flight, expanding their performance envelope.",

Alcids exhibit exceptional dive performance while retaining aerial flight. We hypothesized that alcids maintain efficient Strouhal numbers and stroke velocities across air and water, allowing them to mitigate the costs of their ‘fluid generalism’. We show that alcids cruise at Strouhal numbers between 0.10 and 0.40 – on par with single-fluid specialists – in both air and water but flap their wings ~ 50% slower in water. Thus, these species either contract their muscles at inefficient velocities or maintain a two-geared muscle system, highlighting a clear cost to using the same morphology for locomotion in two fluids. Additionally, alcids varied stroke-plane angle between air and water and chord angle during aquatic flight, expanding their performance envelope.",

These species, which include some or all members of the alcids (<i>Alcidae</i>), ducks (<i>Anatidae</i>), petrels and shearwaters (<i>Procellariidae</i>), dippers (<i>Cinclus</i>), and the penguins (<i>Spheniscidae</i>), use their wings to propel themselves underwater. Wing-propelled diving birds which have retained their ability to fly in the air – hereafter, ‘dual-medium’ species (sensu <a href=\"#bib17\">Kovacs and Meyers, 2000</a>) – are fluid generalists. These animals use the same locomotor apparatus to ‘fly’ in both air and water, and are, therefore, expected to fly poorly relative to strictly aerial and strictly aquatic fliers in each environment.",

As with many dual-medium birds, alcids have high wing-loading (the ratio of body mass to wing area), and therefore display poor maneuverability in aerial flight relative to non-diving birds (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ortega-Jimenez et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Shepard et al., 2019</a>). However, the wing-loadings of alcids and other dual-medium birds are nearly indistinguishable from those of volant birds which use their feet for aquatic locomotion (based on data from <a href=\"#bib1\">Alerstam et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bruderer et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Spear and Ainley, 1997</a>), indicating that high wing-loading is likely the result of selection by the aquatic environment for large body sizes or low buoyancy (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ponganis, 2015</a>), rather than a trade-off specific to dual-medium flight. The current records for the depth and duration of a single dive by an alcid are 210 m and 224 s, respectively, held by the ~1 kg thick-billed murre (<i>Uria lomvia,</i> Linnaeus 1758), making this alcid, on a mass-specific basis, the deepest and longest-duration diver on earth (<a href=\"#bib5\">Croll et al., 1992</a>). When corrected for body size, alcids exhibit dive durations and depths far greater than even penguins (<a href=\"#bib11\">Halsey et al., 2006</a>).",

Strouhal number (<i>St</i> = <i>fAU<sup>−1</sup></i>, where <i>f</i> is wingbeat frequency, <i>A</i> is wing excursion, and <i>U</i> is forward speed) describes the pattern of vortices shed into the fluid wake by a flapping foil as it imparts that momentum (<a href=\"#bib44\">Triantafyllou et al., 1993</a>). Extensive research has determined that peak efficiency (in terms of the power required to flap a foil relative to the thrust output to the fluid) for a simple heaving and pitching foil occurs at around 0.2 &lt; <i>St</i> &lt; 0.4 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anderson et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Triantafyllou et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Triantafyllou et al., 1993</a>). Most flapping and swimming animals studied to date fall within or near that range, with the previously studied, strictly aerial birds exhibiting 0.12 &lt; <i>St</i> &lt; 0.47 during cruising flight (<a href=\"#bib39\">Taylor et al., 2003</a>). That most species fall near the efficient range of <i>St</i> suggests that natural selection has tuned the kinematics of animals to fly and swim efficiently (<a href=\"#bib24\">Nudds et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Taylor et al., 2003</a>). Thus, alcids could achieve efficient fluid wake production in both air and water by maintaining 0.2 &lt; <i>St</i> &lt; 0.4, and efficiency on par with previously studied single-media species by maintaining 0.12 &lt; <i>St</i> &lt; 0.47, but the ‘jack of all trades’ concept suggests that they may unable to do so given the substantial differences in density and viscosity between the two fluids.",

This parameter is likely important in determining the cost of locomotion given that it should be proportional to the contractile velocity of the major flight muscles, the pectoralis and the supracoracoideus (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hamilton, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Tobalske and Dial, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Tobalske et al., 1999</a>). Muscles fibers of a given fiber type and myosin isoform are most efficient at converting metabolic power into mechanical power over a narrow range of contractile velocities (<a href=\"#bib10\">Goldspink, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">He et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Reggiani et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Rome et al., 1988</a>). Thus, it would behoove alcids to operate the fibers in their flight muscles at the contractile velocity which maximizes muscle efficiency, and for that velocity to be shared across aerial and aquatic flight. Otherwise, alcids could maintain two populations of fibers – an aerial set and an aquatic set – but this would add mass to the animal, increasing the cost of aerial flight (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ellington, 1984a</a>). Previous research has demonstrated that diving alcids maintain stroke velocities within a narrow range across dive depths, despite large variations in buoyancy, suggesting that they are responsive to the challenge of maintaining contractile velocity (<a href=\"#bib46\">Watanuki and Sato, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Watanuki et al., 2006</a>). Although researchers have not yet examined myosin isoforms in alcids, the two species of alcids for which histochemical data are available possess only ‘fast’ muscle fibers (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kovacs and Meyers, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Meyers et al., 1992</a>).",

The results of this study strongly suggest that this small alcid maintains optimal <i>St</i> in air and water. We wanted to extend this work to determine if individuals tune their kinematics to match optimal <i>St</i> on a per-flight basis. Alternatively, it is possible that the average kinematics of this species are simply centered between 0.2 &lt; <i>St</i> &lt; 0.4. These authors also suggest, based on wingbeat frequency, that stroke velocities of rhinoceros auklets are lower in water, but were unable to statistically compare stroke velocities during aerial versus aquatic flight. While wingbeat frequencies are different between aquatic and aerial flight (~2–4 Hz versus 7–11 Hz, respectively), wingbeat amplitude may vary between the two environments, allowing for similar stroke velocities.",

Buoyancy is especially strong at shallow depths, as air volumes compress with depth (<a href=\"#bib47\">Wilson et al., 1992</a>). To compensate for buoyancy during horizontal aquatic flight, alcids in this study seemed to produce quick, low excursion wingbeats with near-horizontal chord angles (α) on the upstroke (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Given that the upstroke produces negative heave (ventrally directed acceleration) in swimming alcids (<a href=\"#bib45\">Watanuki et al., 2006</a>), these kinematics seem to be a strategy used to counteract the strong, dorsally oriented buoyancy experienced during horizontal swimming at shallow depths. In contrast, descending alcids must counteract buoyancy as it attempts to resist their forward motion and are, therefore, not required to produce negative heave via the upstroke. Still, all values of <i>St</i> for horizontal aquatic flight overlapped with the range reported for strictly aerial birds in aerial flight – 0.12 &lt; <i>St</i> &lt; 0.47 – (Figure 1), suggesting that alcids produce wakes of similar efficiency to their fully aerial relatives even while fighting buoyancy.",

The paucity of data for animals swimming and flying outside the optimal range of <i>St</i> may be due to the challenge of eliciting inefficient kinematics from animals. Alternatively, because translational velocity is partially determined by wing excursion and frequency, the convergence of <i>St</i> on some range of values may be inevitable. The latter seems unlikely, however, as trout adhere to a narrow range of <i>St</i> despite experimentally-induced disruptions to their kinematics (<a href=\"#bib25\">Nudds et al., 2014</a>).",

To reset the position, alcids elevate and retract the wing during the aerial upstroke. According to <a href=\"#bib15\">Izraelevitz et al., 2018</a>, this stroke-plane angle helps create the vertical force needed to counteract gravity in air. In water, wherein a bird is actually pulled up by buoyancy rather than down by gravity, the top of the stroke plane rotates cranially (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), allowing the bird to orient net force production to counteract drag (<a href=\"#bib15\">Izraelevitz et al., 2018</a>).

The work of <a href=\"#bib16\">Kikuchi et al., 2015</a> suggest a similar result for rhinoceros auklets; however, they report nearly equal wingbeat amplitudes across fluids (87 deg in water, 88 deg in air). Our results may differ because we measured wingbeat amplitude in different ways. <a href=\"#bib16\">Kikuchi et al., 2015</a> relied on the vertical extent of the wingtip in aerial flight and the estimated half-wingspan. Based on our observations, the excursion of the wingtip may not be a reliable measure for inferring contractile velocity. This is because the distal feathers bend considerably during the end of each half-stroke in air, increasing the perceived wingbeat amplitude. This means that stroke velocity measured via the wingtip in aerial flight is not comparable to that measured at the wrist during aquatic flight.",

This is because muscle fibers of a given fiber type and myosin isoform are most efficient over a narrow range of contractile velocities (<a href=\"#bib10\">Goldspink, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">He et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Reggiani et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Rome et al., 1988</a>).

Thus, alcids may rely on different muscles for powering the downstroke in each fluid (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kovacs and Meyers, 2000</a>). Additionally, previous histology research has documented two, ‘fast’ fiber-types in the muscles (both with fast myosin but differing slightly in oxidative and glycolytic capacities) of Atlantic puffins (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kovacs and Meyers, 2000</a>).

The surface of the water measures approximately 10.5 m X 11 m and is approximately 6.5 m deep at its deepest point. The southern edge of the tank is inset with a large glass viewing window approximately 3.5 m wide which extends from ~2 m above the waterline to the floor of the tank.

At the time of this study, the exhibit contained 12 horned puffins, 10 tufted puffins, 4 pigeon guillemots, and 6 common murres. Individuals of each species of alcid regularly swam past the viewing window. Birds opted either to swim parallel to the water’s surface and at depths of 0.5–3 m, presumably for transportation around the tank, or to descend to the bottom of the tank. Given the clear contrasts between these two behaviors, we differentiate between horizontal (trajectory &lt;10 deg) and descending aquatic flight (trajectory <span class=\"underline\">&gt;</span>20 deg).

We chose to use the entire length of the body for calibration, rather than some smaller anatomical length (e.g. culmen), as both the eye and tail were highly conspicuous in all frames of the recorded videos. Visual inspection of the aquatic data revealed pronounced head movement (relative to the body) in sync with the wingbeat cycle (i.e. body length varied with position in the stroke cycle) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lapsansky and Tobalske, 2019</a>). Because of this, we smoothed the raw body-length data using the ‘smoothingspline’ method of fitting in MATLAB and a smoothing parameter of 1e-04 to account for the head movement of the bird.

We were unable to measure airspeed of alcids in aerial flight without disturbing their motion. Luckily, however, flight speeds of three of these species and their relatives have previously recorded in the wild (<a href=\"#bib36\">Spear and Ainley, 1997</a>). <a href=\"#bib36\">Spear and Ainley, 1997</a> categorized alcids as medium (tufted puffins, pigeon guillemots, and rhinoceros auklets) and large (common murres) (<a href=\"#bib36\">Spear and Ainley, 1997</a>). To capture the full range of airspeeds exhibited by each species, we assumed alcids to have flown at the mean airspeed observed for birds of that size class flying in a crosswind ±1.96 * standard deviation of that measure (i.e. 95% prediction interval). Thus, we assumed medium alcids in our study (tufted puffins, pigeon guillemots, and horned puffins) to have flown at airspeeds between 13.95 m s<sup>−1</sup> and 18.65 m s<sup>−1</sup> and large alcids (common murres) to have flown at airspeeds between 13.32 m s<sup>−1</sup> and 24.68 m s<sup>−1</sup>. We also computed <i>St</i> based on ground speed by comparing the movement of flying alcids to stationary objects (e.g. rocks, floating debris, standing waves) in each video.

If anything, this is a slight underestimate of wing excursion, as the hand-wing sometimes appeared to exhibit slightly greater excursions than the wrist (<span class=\"underline\">&lt;</span>10%). However, we chose to digitize the wrist as it was consistently visible in all videos. Frequency was the inverse of the duration of each wingbeat. Chord angle was the angle at mid-stroke between the position vector running from the wingtip to the wrist and that running from the tail to the eye. Stroke-plane angle was calculated as the angle between the bird-centered position vector describing the path of the wrist between its minimum and maximum elevation relative to the direction the bird was traveling. For aquatic flights, used the position of the tail to calculate velocity, as our previous work has demonstrated that the head is an unreliable indicator of overall body motion in swimming alcids (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lapsansky and Tobalske, 2019</a>). Details of the velocity calculation, including how we corrected for the effects of pitching in our calculation, are described in more detail in <a href=\"#bib18\">Lapsansky and Tobalske, 2019</a>. The velocity due to pitching of the body was typically &lt;5% of the translational velocity.

Thus, flights were selected for analysis when birds appeared to fly horizontally and straight at or straight away from the camera (±10 deg). For all flights (n = 80), we digitized the wrist and the shoulder of each bird at the maximum and minimum elevation of each wingbeat to calculate wingbeat amplitude (deg). Stroke velocity was computed as the change in angle (deg) over the duration (sec) of the stroke. For aquatic flights, this computation was performed on a stroke-by-stroke basis. For aerial flights of common murres, horned puffins, and tufted puffins, the relatively slow frame rate meant that computing the duration of each individual stroke would provide only a coarse measurement of stroke duration. Thus, we opted to compute stroke duration for flights of these species as 0.5 * the inverse of the wingbeat frequency of that flight. We validated this approximation by computing stroke duration via both methods for the aerial flight of pigeon guillemots, finding no significant differences between the two calculations (Upstroke: <i>t-Stat</i> = 1.67, <i>Cohen’s d</i> = 0.037, p=0.10, <i>n</i> = 70 half-strokes; Downstroke: <i>t-Stat</i> = 0.71, p=0.48, <i>Cohen’s d</i> = 0.019, <i>n</i> = 70 half-strokes; paired t-tests). While the frame rate was relatively low for aerial flights of common murres, horned puffins, and tufted puffins (29.97 or 59.94 fps), the long exposure of the video (auto-shutter) made it relatively easy to locate the top and bottom of each stroke, as the wing briefly pauses before the turnaround.

The manuscript comprises impressive scope and a large amount of careful work.

The laboratory-like facility in Alaska for underwater filming of captive birds is a wonderful resource and its use is allied with filming of free flying pigeon guillemots from land in Monterey and following murres and puffins with a helicopter. Data are presented in clear, convincing and attractive figures. The manuscript raises interesting hypotheses for further work, including regional specialisation of muscles inserting on the sternum that are recruited differentially when the stroke angle changes between media.

We were attempting to point out that a trade-off in flight performance caused by using the wings for locomotion in two media is not well-established, but our phrasing made it seem that we were arguing against an aerial-terrestrial trade-off altogether. Hopefully, the revised text is clearer.",

Based on wing measurements from the sources mentioned in the introduction, the wing shapes (at least in the parameters typically measured) of alcids and Anatidae, including many foot-propelled diving ducks, ‘non-diving’ ducks, and geese, overlap entirely. Shearwaters, which routinely dive down to 60 m (Croll and Tershy, 2012) [deeper than most alcids], have very different wing shapes from most diving birds, as do boobies and gannets. These data have not been rigorously analyzed, so most of discussion related to the wing shapes of diving birds has been removed from the paper. But until this question has been addressed with multivariate data, in a phylogenetic context, we feel caution precludes describing the wings of wing-propelled divers as being different in shape from those of other flying birds.",
