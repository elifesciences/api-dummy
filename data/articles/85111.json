One way that prediction errors could drive learning is by activating neuromodulatory systems to gate plasticity. The catecholaminergic locus coeruleus (LC) is a major neuromodulatory system involved in neuronal plasticity in the cortex. Using two-photon calcium imaging in mice exploring a virtual environment, we found that the activity of LC axons in the cortex correlated with the magnitude of unsigned visuomotor prediction errors. LC response profiles were similar in both motor and visual cortical areas, indicating that LC axons broadcast prediction errors throughout the dorsal cortex. While imaging calcium activity in layer 2/3 of the primary visual cortex, we found that optogenetic stimulation of LC axons facilitated learning of a stimulus-specific suppression of visual responses during locomotion. This plasticity – induced by minutes of LC stimulation – recapitulated the effect of visuomotor learning on a scale that is normally observed during visuomotor development across days. We conclude that prediction errors drive LC activity, and that LC activity facilitates sensorimotor plasticity in the cortex, consistent with a role in modulating learning rates.",

For instance, learning the precise relationship between motor commands and the resulting visual feedback is the basis for both feedback control of movements as well as distinguishing self-generated from externally generated sensory feedback. One way that the brain may learn to do this is via predictive processing (<a href=\"#bib31\">Keller and Mrsic-Flogel, 2018</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Rao and Ballard, 1999</a>). In a sensorimotor version of this framework, the brain learns an internal model which transforms motor activity into a prediction of the sensory consequences. The framework postulates that specific neurons are responsible for computing discrepancies – known as prediction errors – between the prediction and the actual sensory inputs received. The neocortex has been shown to compute signals consistent with sensorimotor prediction errors (<a href=\"#bib14\">Eliades and Wang, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Keller and Mrsic-Flogel, 2018</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Schneider et al., 2018</a>). In the primary visual cortex (V1), excitatory neurons in layer 2/3 compute mismatches between visual flow speed and locomotion speed (<a href=\"#bib2\">Attinger et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Jordan and Keller, 2020</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Keller et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Zmarz and Keller, 2016</a>). Such sensorimotor prediction error responses in the cortex depend on ongoing and developmental experience with sensorimotor coupling (<a href=\"#bib2\">Attinger et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Schneider et al., 2018</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Vasilevskaya et al., 2022</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Widmer et al., 2022</a>), and therefore the computation underlying them is actively learned. In predictive processing, one main function of prediction errors is to drive corrective plasticity in the internal model that generates predictions (<a href=\"#bib31\">Keller and Mrsic-Flogel, 2018</a>).",

                            "text": "During the first sensorimotor experience in life, prediction errors should strongly drive learning of an internal model of the world, while later in life, prediction errors should update internal models primarily when overall prediction errors are abundant (for instance, in novel or volatile situations). One way to implement such a developmental or contextual shift in the amount of plasticity induced by a particular prediction error would be a gating signal. The characteristics of a gating signal are that it is activated by prediction errors and that it permits increases in plasticity. In addition, because it is not driving plasticity, but simply gating it, it can be low dimensional (i.e. the same for all neurons). Prime candidates for a gating signal are neuromodulatory systems. Dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain signal reward prediction errors (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kim et al., 2020</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Schultz, 2016</a>) and action prediction errors (<a href=\"#bib21\">Greenstreet et al., 2022</a>), which are thought to gate plasticity in downstream targets to support learning of stimulus-reward associations and goal directed behavior (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cox and Witten, 2019</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Flagel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Reynolds et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Steinberg et al., 2013</a>). Indeed, the catecholamines – dopamine and noradrenaline – regulate and gate plasticity in the cortex (<a href=\"#bib8\">Choi et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">He et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Seol et al., 2007</a>). However, the midbrain dopaminergic system projects only sparsely to most of the sensory neocortex of the mouse, including V1 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Nomura et al., 2014</a>), where visuomotor predictions are thought to be learned (<a href=\"#bib2\">Attinger et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Widmer et al., 2022</a>). Instead, the major catecholaminergic input to the cortex is the locus coeruleus (LC). LC activity has primarily been investigated in the context of classical stimulus presentations and reinforcement tasks. Such studies have shown that the LC responds to many different events, including unexpected task outcomes (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bouret and Sara, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Breton-Provencher et al., 2022</a>), novelty (<a href=\"#bib58\">Takeuchi et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Vankov et al., 1995</a>), and unexpected sensory stimuli in general (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aston-Jones and Bloom, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Deitcher et al., 2019</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Foote et al., 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hervé-Minvielle and Sara, 1995</a>). In zebrafish, noradrenergic neurons increase their activity during the prolonged visuomotor mismatches of failed swim attempts to drive ‘giving up’ behavior (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mu et al., 2019</a>). We hypothesized that if the mouse LC is activated during similar visuomotor mismatches, this could represent visuomotor prediction error signaling that would function to gate prediction error driven plasticity in output circuits like the cortex.",

We found that LC axons in both sensory and motor cortical regions respond to unsigned visuomotor prediction errors, that is, unpredicted visual motion or unpredicted visual halts during locomotion. We then combined optogenetic LC axon stimulation with two-photon calcium imaging of layer 2/3 neurons in V1, to show that the LC greatly facilitates a form of plasticity consistent with predictive visuomotor learning: learned suppression of nasotemporal visual flow responses during forward locomotion. These results support the idea that a key function of the LC is to facilitate prediction-error-driven cortical plasticity.",

To record LC axonal activity, we expressed axon-targeted, Cre-dependent GCaMP6s in noradrenergic neurons of the LC via stereotactic viral vector injections in 13 NET-Cre mice (NET = norepinephrine transporter; <a href=\"#bib62\">Wagatsuma et al., 2018</a>). We confirmed that these injections labelled only cells in the LC, and that GCaMP6s positive cells were also immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase, a marker for catecholaminergic neurons (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</a>). For two-photon imaging, we implanted a 4 mm imaging window either over the right V1 and surrounding cortical regions (posterior cortex, 9 mice), or over the right primary and secondary motor cortices (anterior cortex, 4 mice). Prior to imaging, mice were habituated to a virtual reality (VR) system consisting of a virtual tunnel, with walls patterned with vertical sinusoidal gratings (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). In the closed loop condition, locomotion was coupled to visual movement of the tunnel, and in open loop conditions, the walls moved independent of mouse locomotion. After habituation to head-fixation, we began imaging across up to five non-overlapping fields of view (FoV) in each imaging window, yielding a total of 31 posterior cortex FoVs and 9 anterior cortex FoVs. Axonal fluorescence showed strong correlations with pupil diameter (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</a>) typical for LC axons (<a href=\"#bib46\">Reimer et al., 2016</a>), rapid responses to air puffs (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</a>) as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib6\">Breton-Provencher et al., 2022</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Deitcher et al., 2019</a>), and increases in fluorescence at locomotion onset that decayed during the locomotion bout (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</a>) consistent with earlier work (<a href=\"#bib46\">Reimer et al., 2016</a>). We found that within a FoV, individual axon segments exhibited highly correlated activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–F</a>). Given that the algorithms that identify axons (i.e. determine whether two axon segments belong to the same axon) rely on temporal correlations of activity (<a href=\"#bib33\">Leinweber et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Mukamel et al., 2009</a>), axon segmentation is difficult in these data. Thus, to prevent oversampling of the data, we pooled data from all axon segments within a FoV for further analysis.",

Responses to visuomotor mismatch in closed loop conditions should be higher than responses to a replay of the same visual flow halt (termed ‘playback halt’) in open loop conditions, even when the mouse is locomoting. Playback halts are visually identical to mismatches but occur independent of whether the mouse is stationary or locomoting (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Responses of LC axons to playback halts when the mouse was stationary were negative and substantially different from mismatch responses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C–D</a>), demonstrating that the response of LC axons to visuomotor mismatch cannot be explained by the visual stimulus alone. The mismatch responses also could not be explained by a locomotion driven increase in gain of the visual halt response: (a) The average playback halt response when the mouse was stationary was negative, (b) there was no correlation between playback halt responses and mismatch responses across different FoVs (R<sup>2</sup>=0.04, p=0.31, 25 FoVs, linear regression), and (c) mismatch responses were significantly larger than playback halt responses that occurred during locomotion in the open loop condition (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). This indicated that responses in LC axons were acutely dependent on visuomotor coupling, since the only difference between a mismatch stimulus and a playback halt during locomotion is that the former occurs during visuomotor coupling and the latter does not.",

Since visual flow speed is zero during mismatch, and visual flow is perfectly coupled to locomotion prior to mismatch, the visuomotor error is proportional to the locomotion speed during mismatch (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Indeed, we found that LC axonal mismatch responses increased monotonically with the locomotion speed of the mouse (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>).

However, these are not the only type of prediction error in our paradigm. In the open loop condition, visual flow onsets result in positive prediction errors (i.e., a condition with <i>more</i> visual flow than expected), especially when the mouse is stationary. We thus assessed the responses of LC axons to visual flow onsets in the open loop condition (i.e. uncoupled from locomotion). We found that LC axons showed significant responses to visual flow onsets, but only when the mouse was stationary (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F–G</a>). Visual flow onsets during locomotion did not evoke significant responses on average. Altogether, LC axonal responsiveness to visual and visuomotor stimuli was best explained by the absolute (i.e. unsigned) error between locomotion and visual flow speeds (|Error|=|Speed<sub>locomotion</sub>– Speed<sub>visual flow</sub>|). Changes in the absolute error resulted in corresponding changes in the activity in LC axons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C and F</a>), and responses scaled with the size of Δ|Error| (i.e. the change in unsigned error magnitude, see Methods) across the different stimulus conditions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>).",

To assess the heterogeneity of LC signaling across the cortex, we first compared the calcium responses of LC axons between two imaging window locations: the anterior cortex (the primary and secondary motor cortex), and the posterior cortex (V1 and surrounding regions; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We found very similar responses to visuomotor mismatches, playback halts (stationary) and visual flow onsets (stationary; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B–C</a>), as well as air puffs and locomotion onsets at these two locations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B and D</a>), and there were no significant differences in the responses between the two locations. These results are consistent with the idea that the LC sends similar visuomotor and locomotion related signals to distinct regions of the cortex, in line with recent findings showing that LC axons in different cortical regions show responses to the same sensory stimuli (<a href=\"#bib11\">Deitcher et al., 2019</a>).",

                                    "text": "What could be the function of prediction errors signaled by the LC to the cortex? One possibility is that cortical prediction errors, like mismatch responses in V1 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Keller et al., 2012</a>), are enhanced by LC output in order to augment error driven learning. Indeed, a prevalent idea is that noradrenaline is a mediator of gain modulation in the cortex (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ferguson and Cardin, 2020</a>), including the gain increase in V1 during locomotion (<a href=\"#bib44\">Polack et al., 2013</a>). To test whether the LC may enhance prediction error responses in cortical layer 2/3, we assessed the impact of transient LC axon stimulation on cortical responses using an optogenetic strategy (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). First, we injected an AAV vector encoding Cre-dependent excitatory red-light activated opsin, ChrimsonR, into the right LC of 8 NET-Cre mice, while injecting a vector encoding jGCaMP8m into the right V1 to drive non-specific neuronal expression. An imaging window was then implanted over the right V1. Mice underwent habituation to the virtual reality system before calcium imaging of V1 neurons during (1) a closed loop condition with mismatches and (2) an open loop condition with 1 s fixed-speed visual flow stimuli. During imaging, we stimulated ChrimsonR by directing a 637 nm laser through the objective into the imaging window (27 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>, in 15ms pulses presented at 20 Hz). This stimulation was presented (a) alone in closed loop conditions, (b) coupled to a random 50% of mismatches (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), and (c) coupled to a random 50% of open loop visual flow stimuli. To assess the visual effects of optical stimulation of ChrimsonR (<a href=\"#bib10\">Danskin et al., 2015</a>) in absence of the effects of optogenetically stimulating LC axons, we also imaged from a second group of six mice treated in an identical manner, but without ChrimsonR expression in the LC (control mice). Two mice were excluded from the LC-injected group due to low density of axonal labelling with tdTomato in V1, leaving 6 ChrimsonR-expressing mice in the dataset (see Methods).",

This was most notable when plotting the difference in average response between trials with concurrent laser stimulation and those without: there were transient increases in response during laser-on trials at visual flow onset, and this effect was significantly different between ChrimsonR-expressing and control groups only during brief time-windows at the onset/resumption of visual flow (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E–F</a>). However, this effect was small and not evident in average responses. Averaging across the full response duration, we found no significant effects of laser stimulation, both when comparing trials with and without laser stimulation in the ChrimsonR-expressing group, and when comparing the difference in response size between ChrimsonR-expressing and control mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E–F</a>).

To quantify potential cell-type-specific effects of LC axon stimulation, we thus split the population of neurons into three groups based on locomotion onset responses (see <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</a> and Methods): the group with the strongest visuomotor mismatch responses (NPE), the group with the strongest visual flow responses (PPE), and an intermediate population (Other). We found no evidence for an effect of optogenetic stimulation of LC axons on average mismatch and visual flow responses across any of these cell groups (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G–H</a>). We thus concluded that transient LC axon stimulation in the awake state has only a minor direct effect on the responses of neurons in layer 2/3 of V1. These results are largely in line with recent work demonstrating a lack of effect of LC stimulation on baseline firing in cortical pyramidal neurons, and an enhancement of transient responses to afferent input (<a href=\"#bib61\">Vazey et al., 2018</a>).",

The LC is thought to be involved in cortical plasticity (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kasamatsu et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kasamatsu and Pettigrew, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Martins and Froemke, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Shepard et al., 2015</a>). Catecholamine receptors in V1 are known to modulate synaptic plasticity by activating intracellular signaling cascades and interacting with eligibility traces (<a href=\"#bib8\">Choi et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">He et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Nomura et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Seol et al., 2007</a>). One plausible function of LC sensorimotor prediction errors is to gate the plasticity that underlies learning of sensorimotor predictions, for example, the prediction of visual feedback during locomotion. Primary sensory cortices can indeed learn to suppress the sensory consequences of locomotion, driving selective reductions of responses to locomotion-coupled inputs (<a href=\"#bib51\">Schneider et al., 2018</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Widmer et al., 2022</a>).",

In V1, there is a known increase in the size of visual responses during locomotion compared to stationary periods (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bennett et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Erisken et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Niell and Stryker, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Pakan et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Polack et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Zmarz and Keller, 2016</a>). Analyzing only trials where the optogenetic stimulation laser was not on, we found that this canonical gain increase was present for control mice but reversed in sign in ChrimsonR-expressing mice: Visual responses during locomotion were suppressed on average relative to stationary periods (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>). This resulted in a significantly lower locomotion modulation index (see Methods) for ChrimsonR-expressing relative to control mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>). Since episodic LC axon stimulation occurred throughout the whole imaging session (i.e. across 10 min in the closed loop condition, prior to the presentation of open loop visual flow stimuli), it is possible that the reversal of locomotion modulation index reflects a result of plasticity induced by earlier LC axon stimulation.",

To do this, we designed an experiment to assess the impact of LC axon stimulation on neuronal learning about visuomotor coupling (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We expressed jGCaMP8m in neurons in V1 of 19 mice. Twelve mice also had AAV vector injections into the LC to express ChrimsonR in NET-positive neurons, while the remaining seven underwent no injection into the LC to serve as controls for the non-optogenetic effects of the protocol. Mice were habituated to the VR as before and we then proceeded to two-photon imaging in layer 2/3 of V1. During the imaging session, mice would first be exposed to 5 min of 1 s fixed-speed open loop visual flow presentations, to quantify the gain-change of visual flow responses during locomotion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Mice were then exposed for 5–10 min to either (a) a closed loop condition where visual flow and locomotion are coupled, or (b) an open loop replay of visual flow generated from a previous closed loop session. During this session, LC axons would be periodically optogenetically stimulated as before (15ms pulses, presented at 20 Hz for 1 s every 7 s on average) to simulate phasic LC responses (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Afterwards, the open loop visual flow presentations would be repeated to quantify how the previous LC axon stimulation affected visual responses. To assess the stimulus specificity with which visual responses changed, we presented both nasotemporal and temporonasal visual flow (mice see the former during forward locomotion in the closed loop condition; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). If LC axon stimulation results in enhanced plasticity of locomotion based predictions of visual flow, we would expect the following observations: (1) Suppression of visual flow responses by locomotion is enhanced after stimulation of LC axons in closed loop conditions, (2) this suppression is specific to the type of visual flow seen during forward locomotion (nasotemporal), (3) the effect depends on ChrimsonR expression in the LC, and (4) the effect is absent when LC axons are instead stimulated during open loop conditions (i.e. the effect depends on visuomotor coupling).",

We split the LC-injected dataset into high ChrimsonR expression (six mice) and low ChrimsonR expression (six mice) according to V1 axonal expression level (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</a>). Low ChrimsonR-expressing mice had optogenetically evoked pupil dilations that were not statistically distinguishable from controls, while high ChrimsonR-expressing mice had overt pupil dilations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</a>). For the following analyses, we excluded 8 (5) of 49 (25) sessions from the ChrimsonR (control) dataset due to lack of locomotion during those sessions (see Methods). At the beginning of the imaging session, prior to optogenetic stimulation, neurons in layer 2/3 showed a pronounced positive locomotion modulation index for both the nasotemporal and temporonasal visual flow responses, both in high and low ChrimsonR-expressing mice and in control mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C–E</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</a>). Quantifying visual flow responses in high ChrimsonR-expressing mice after optogenetic stimulation during closed loop visuomotor experience revealed a significant reduction in the locomotion modulation index for nasotemporal visual flow responses (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). This originated from a reduction in the response to visual flow during locomotion, while responses during stationary periods remained stable (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). This effect was specific to the direction of visual flow seen during forward locomotion, since locomotion modulation index was preserved for temporonasal visual flow responses (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), with negligible changes in response size both during locomotion and stationary periods (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>).

In the latter case, response size reduction should be the same if optogenetic stimulation takes place during open loop replay of the same visual flow seen during closed loop conditions. To assess this, we repeated the same experiment, but instead of stimulating LC axons during the closed loop condition, we stimulated LC axons during open loop replays of visual flow from previous closed loop sessions of the same mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>).

This suggests that the increase in locomotion driven suppression after LC axon stimulation is caused by a similar form of plasticity to that seen when visuomotor experience is constrained to the virtual reality across days. If this is the case, we should see similarities in the properties of the locomotion driven suppression. First, we looked at the locomotion speed dependence of the suppression. If the negative locomotion modulation index results from learning to suppress visual responses according to a locomotion driven prediction of visual flow, the degree of suppression should depend on locomotion speed. As locomotion speed increased, visual flow responses were increasingly suppressed in coupled trained mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), while this was not evident in normally reared mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). For nasotemporal visual flow responses in ChrimsonR-expressing mice, locomotion modulation index was positive and did not change with locomotion speed at the start of the imaging session, but after stimulation of LC axons in closed loop conditions, locomotion modulation index became increasingly negative as locomotion speed increased (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F–G</a>). Thus, the locomotion driven suppression of visual flow emerging after stimulating LC axons in closed loop conditions was locomotion speed dependent in a similar manner to the locomotion driven suppression seen in coupled trained mice. Note that in high ChrimsonR-expressing mice, suppression of visual flow was seen at high locomotion speeds only (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>), but in coupled trained mice, some level of suppression was evident across all speeds (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). This could be due to differences in visual flow speed presented: for coupled trained mice, the stimuli analyzed are visual flow onsets during open loop replay; thus, the visual flow speed will cover a similar range as the locomotion speed distribution of the mice. For high ChrimsonR-expressing mice, the stimuli are presented at a fixed visual flow speed that often exceeds the locomotion speed of the mouse. Thus, the fact that suppression only appears at the highest locomotion speed in these mice is consistent with a suppression of visual flow input based on a locomotion speed dependent expectation. In addition to the similarities in locomotion speed dependence of suppression in the two groups, the pattern of change in locomotion modulation index across different functional layer 2/3 cell groups also appeared similar between high ChrimsonR-expressing and coupled trained mice (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</a>).",

What these quantities have in common is that they essentially are metrics for the inaccuracy of the brain’s internal models. One way to implement such a measure would be to integrate prediction errors from across the brain and then broadcast this signal back across the brain. Indeed, we found that the LC sends unsigned visuomotor prediction errors non-specifically across the dorsal cortex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2</a>). Models hypothesizing that the LC reports the global inaccuracy of the brain’s internal models suggest that the purpose of this is to increase learning rates in output circuits like the cortex, enabling internal models to be modified more rapidly. In line with this, we found that stimulating cortical LC axons during closed loop visuomotor coupling over minutes reduces and even reverses the canonical locomotion related gain of visual flow responses in layer 2/3 of V1, in a manner specific to the direction of the movement-coupled stimulus (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Surprisingly, this enhanced plasticity seems to happen even with only a small direct effect of LC axon stimulation on average calcium responses (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). This plasticity, on the timescale of minutes, recapitulates the effect of restricting visuomotor experience to the closed loop coupling in virtual reality across days (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), suggesting that it reflects an acceleration of a slower form of visuomotor plasticity (i.e., an increased learning rate).",

The responses we found in LC axons to the various visual flow stimuli were proportional to the change in the degree of error between visual flow and locomotion speeds (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). This supports a model in which the LC signals prediction errors, and combined with previous findings, suggests that prediction errors of all modalities are a general feature of LC signaling. Both positive and negative visuomotor prediction errors appear to be computed in layer 2/3 of the primary visual cortex (<a href=\"#bib26\">Jordan and Keller, 2020</a>) and activate the anterior cingulate cortex (<a href=\"#bib23\">Heindorf and Keller, 2022</a>) – an area that projects directly to the LC. Thus, the LC likely inherits prediction errors computed upstream in areas like the cortex. Based on the multimodality and unsigned nature of LC responses, and the integrate and broadcast nature of its input-output anatomy (<a href=\"#bib53\">Schwarz et al., 2015</a>), our working model of LC function is as follows: The LC integrates prediction errors of all modalities to compute a measure of how inaccurately internal models are currently predicting the global sensory inputs of the animal. The LC does not signal what <i>type</i> of prediction error occurred, but what the global rate of prediction errors currently is (i.e. a measure of surprise). The resulting LC output does not directly <i>drive</i> model updating in cortical output areas, but it modulates the rate at which local cortical prediction errors drive plasticity in internal models. Thus, the specificity of how internal models are changed depends on ongoing prediction errors in the cortex, and the LC input acts to control the learning rate, modulating the extent to which these cortical prediction errors drive plasticity. This would allow the LC to be a controller of plasticity in internal models: when prediction error rates are high (i.e. during developmental, novel, or volatile situations), updating of internal models will be more rapid as a result of increased LC output. To support this hypothesis, it is important for future work to expand the range of LC stimulation parameters tested to identify the function between LC activation level and cortical plasticity, as well as cortical representations.",

LC calcium responses to locomotion onsets, which have been shown previously in LC axons (<a href=\"#bib11\">Deitcher et al., 2019</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Reimer et al., 2016</a>), were generally larger than visual flow or visuomotor mismatch responses (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</a>). This could be the result of a direct movement related input unrelated to prediction errors, or the result of prediction errors that are not driven by differences between forward locomotion and backward visual flow. Increases in activity occurring after locomotion onset could reflect vestibulomotor prediction errors that result from the fact that the mouse is head-fixed, or visuomotor prediction errors for motor attempts we do not record, like turns or head movements. We do find that visuomotor prediction errors contribute to locomotion onset responses, as locomotion onset responses in the open loop condition are smaller during visual flow, when locomotion evoked visuomotor error is lower (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</a>). However, LC calcium activity also rises prior to locomotion onset, creating the additional possibility of an internally generated movement onset response. Other kinds of movement are also correlated with LC firing, including pup retrievals (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dvorkin and Shea, 2022</a>) and lever pressing (<a href=\"#bib6\">Breton-Provencher et al., 2022</a>). These movement onset responses could also reflect other forms of prediction error, including action prediction errors (<a href=\"#bib21\">Greenstreet et al., 2022</a>) or temporal difference reward prediction errors (in cases where the movement is associated with reward expectation) similar to those documented in the dopaminergic system (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kim et al., 2020</a>).

Loss of function experiments can suffer from the potential confound that catecholamines may simply be necessary for normal neuronal activity, and the loss of plasticity may be a secondary effect of a disruption in neuronal function. Indeed, acute noradrenergic receptor block can silence neurons in layer 2/3, and massively reduce the amplitude of visual inputs (<a href=\"#bib44\">Polack et al., 2013</a>). In gain-of-function experiments, electrical stimulation of the LC has been shown to partially restore ocular dominance plasticity in adult cats (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kasamatsu et al., 1985</a>). Here, we also performed a gain of function experiment: we show that a few minutes of optogenetic LC axon stimulation in V1 of adult mice during visuomotor coupling can recapitulate the developmental effects of constrained exposure to visuomotor coupling in the virtual reality (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>). While our optogenetic stimulation is likely far more constrained to LC neurons than previous electrical stimulations, we cannot rule out a systemic effect of the LC axon stimulation. We know that we are likely antidromically activating the LC with our optogenetic stimulation owing to the resulting pupil dilation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4B</a>). Given that LC neurons are electrically coupled (<a href=\"#bib36\">McKinney et al., 2022</a>) and have widely divergent axons, our stimulation likely has effects on other LC output targets, such as other neuromodulatory systems, and other areas of the cortex. Thus, the plasticity effect that we measure may not entirely result from LC output in V1 alone. However, since the LC will never be acting in isolation and broadcasts its output to different cortical areas, the functional impact of LC axon stimulation in this experiment is strongly suggestive of a role in facilitating plasticity. Future work will be needed to understand the circuit locus of plasticity generated by this paradigm, and its dependence on particular neuromodulators (e.g. dopamine and noradrenaline). The fact that the plasticity occurs despite only minor effects of LC stimulation on neuronal activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) indicates that the LC can either enhance plasticity without affecting activity levels, for instance via the molecular cascades or eligibility traces activated by GPCRs (<a href=\"#bib22\">He et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hong et al., 2022</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Seol et al., 2007</a>), and/or that a part of the relevant circuit outside of layer 2/3 is more strongly modulated by LC activation.",

The behavioral relevance of the LC-gated plasticity in our study is yet to be demonstrated, but we can conjecture some perceptual functions of the plasticity based on its nature: learned suppression of reafferent visual flow during locomotion. This theoretically would be useful at the perceptual level for detection of external moving objects during movement, or for detecting changes in the geometry of the environment through which the animal is moving. Novel behavioral paradigms for assessing these percepts could be used in future studies to demonstrate the behavioral impact of the plasticity that we see.",

For V1 layer 2/3 neurons, neuronal somata were manually selected based on mean and maximum fluorescence images. Average fluorescence per region of interest (ROI) was corrected for slow fluorescence drift over time using an 8<sup>th</sup> percentile filter and a 1000 frame window, and divided by the median value over the entire trace to calculate ΔF/F (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dombeck et al., 2007</a>). For LC axonal data (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2</a>), there were a number of alternative/additional steps. First, all ROIs within an image above a manually set fluorescence threshold were selected. Non-axonal ROIs from this set were then removed in two ways: first, a ‘circularity index’ (circularity index = 4π x area/perimeter<sup>2</sup>) and area threshold were used. ROIs with circularity index above 0.14 or a total area below 150 pixels were excluded – this served to remove non-axonal structures. Second, any ROI without evidence of calcium activity was removed: a fast Fourier transform was used to obtain the power spectrum of the ΔF/F trace. From this, the signal-to-noise ratio of the calcium signal was calculated, where noise was calculated as the average power between 3 and 8 Hz. ROIs with power below a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 in the frequency band from 0.05 to 1 Hz (classified as signal) were excluded. This served to remove uncommon elongated non-axonal ROIs, such as blood vessel walls. Next, due to the lower signal to noise of the axonal recordings, the ΔF/F recorded at 60 Hz was low pass filtered at 10 Hz. Finally, due to the high correlation of ΔF/F between LC axonal ROIs within a field of view (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–F</a>), ΔF/F was averaged across all axonal ROIs within a field of view.",

Pupil diameter was measured offline by fitting a circle to the pupil, which was backlit by the 930 nm laser light of the two-photon microscope. Pupil diameter traces were z-scored by subtracting the mean of the entire trace and dividing by the standard deviation of the entire trace. To calculate optogenetically induced pupil dilations, the average baseline pupil diameter (in the 1 s prior to stimulus onset) was subtracted from the response for each trial, then the pupil diameter response was averaged across trials. Trials including blinks were excluded.",

For data where the experimental unit was neurons, we used hierarchical bootstrapping (<a href=\"#bib50\">Saravanan et al., 2020</a>) for statistical testing due to the nested structure (neurons and mice) of the data. To do this, we first resampled the data (with replacement) at the level of imaging sites. From the selected set of imaging sites, we then resampled the data (with replacement) at the level of neurons. We then computed the mean of this bootstrap sample. This would be repeated 10 000 times to generate a distribution of mean values. For paired tests, the p-value was calculated as the proportion of this distribution that was higher or lower than zero, depending on the null hypothesis. For unpaired tests, the p-value was calculated as the proportion of the distribution higher or lower than the values from the distribution of the compared dataset, depending on the hypothesis. For the bootstrap tests for negative regression slopes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E and G</a>), the slope of the linear regression fit was calculated for the 10 000 bootstrapped datasets, and the p-value was taken as the proportion of the distribution with a linear regression fit slope exceeding zero. For data where the experimental unit was FoV (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2</a>) or mice (pupil dilation, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</a>), t-tests were used to compare datasets that conformed with normality and did not show statistically distinguishable variances. Datasets that did not conform with normality or had unequal variances were compared with Rank-sum tests. Paired t-tests were used to test the mean of a population against zero when the data was normally distributed, otherwise signed-rank tests were used to test the median against zero (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>).",

As the authors mentioned that Polack et al 2013 showed a significant effect of NE blockers in membrane potential and firing rate in V1 layer2/3 neurons during locomotion, it would be useful to test the effect of LC silencing (coupled to mismatch training) on both cellular response and cortical plasticity or applying NE antagonists in V1 in addition to LC optical stimulation. The latter experiment will also address which neuromodulator mediates plasticity, given that LC could co-release other modulators such as dopamine (Takeuchi et al. 2016 and Kempadoo et al. 2016). LC silencing experiment would establish a causal effect more convincingly than the activation experiment.",

It has been shown that catecholamines can gate plasticity by acting on eligibility traces at synapses (He et al., 2015; Hong et al., 2022). In addition, all catecholamine receptors are metabotropic and influence intracellular signaling cascades, e.g., via adenylyl cyclase and phospholipases. Catecholamines can gate LTP and LTD via these signaling pathways in vitro (Seol et al., 2007). Both of these influences on plasticity at the molecular level do not necessitate or predict an effect on calcium activity levels. We have now expanded on this in the discussion of the revised manuscript.",

The problem with a loss of function experiment here is that neuromodulators like noradrenaline affect general aspects of neuronal function. This is apparent in Polack et al., 2013: during the pharmacological blocking experiment, the membrane hyperpolarizes, membrane variance becomes very low, and the cells are effectively silenced (Figure 7 of (Polack et al., 2013)), demonstrating an immediate impact on neuronal function when noradrenaline receptor activation is presumably taken below physiological/waking levels. In light of this, if we reduce LC output/noradrenergic receptor activation and find that plasticity is prevented, this could be the result of a direct influence on the plasticity process, or, the result of a disruption of another aspect of neuronal function, like synaptic transmission or spiking. We would therefore challenge the reviewer’s statement that a loss-of-function experiment would establish a causal effect more convincingly than the gain- of-function experiment that we performed.",

Control mice show no sign of plasticity in locomotion modulation index (LMI) on the 10-minute timescale (Figure 4J), thus we would not expect to see any effect when blocking plasticity in this experiment. We would need to use dark-rearing and coupled- training of mice in the VR across development to elicit the relevant plasticity ((Attinger et al., 2017); manuscript Figure 5). We would then need to silence LC activity across days of VR experience to prevent the expected physiological levels of plasticity. Applying NE antagonists in V1 over the entire period of development seems very difficult. This would leave optogenetically silencing axons locally, which in addition to the problems of doing this acutely (Mahn et al., 2016; Raimondo et al., 2012), has not been demonstrated to work chronically over the duration of weeks. Thus, a negative result in this experiment will be difficult to interpret, and likely uninformative: We will not be able to distinguish whether the experimental approach did not work, or whether local LC silencing does nothing to plasticity. Note that pharmacologically blocking noradrenaline receptors during LC stimulation in the plasticity experiment is also particularly challenging: they would need to be blocked throughout the entire 15 minute duration of the experiment with no changes in concentration of antagonist between the ‘before’ and ‘after’ phases, since the block itself is likely to affect the response size, as seen in Polack et al., 2013, creating a confound for plasticity-related changes in response size.

The stimulation strength is intrinsically consistent in our study in the sense that the stimulation level to test for changes in neuronal activity is similar to that used to probe for plasticity effects. We suspect that the artificial activation results in much stronger LC activity than seen during mismatch responses, given that no sign of the plasticity in LMI seen in high ChrimsonR occurs in low ChrimsonR or control mice (Figure 4J). Note, that our conclusions do not rely on the assumption that the stimulation is matched to physiological levels of activation during the visuomotor mismatches that we assayed. The hypothesis that we put forward is that increasing levels of activation of the LC (reflecting increasing rates or amplitude of prediction errors across the brain) will result in increased levels of plasticity. We know that LC axons can reach levels of activity far higher than that seen during visuomotor mismatches, for instance during air puff responses, which constitute a form of positive prediction error (unexpected tactile input) (Figures 2C and S1C). The visuomotor mismatches used in this study were only used to demonstrate that LC activity is consistent with prediction error signaling.

Indeed, the comparison in Figure 2 seems a bit incomplete since only \"posterior versus anterior\" comparisons have been performed and not within-group comparisons. I believe it is hard to properly assess differences or similarities between calcium signal amplitude measured in different mice and cranial windows as they are subject to important variability (caused by different levels of viral expression for instance).

In contrast to these studies, we do not see a major effect of LC stimulation either on baseline or evoked calcium activity (Figure 3), and, if anything, we see a minor potentiation of transient visual flow onset responses (see also Author Response Figure 2).

Electrical stimulation of the LC as used by previous studies differs from our optogenetic method in that LC axons will be stimulated across much wider regions of the brain (affecting both the cortex and many of its inputs), and it is not clear whether the cause of cortical response changes is in cortex or subcortical.

The study with the most similar methodology to ours is (Vazey et al., 2018), which used optogenetic stimulation directly into the mouse LC while recording spiking in deep layers of the somatosensory cortex with extracellular electrodes. Like us, they found that phasic optogenetic stimulation alone did not alter baseline spiking activity (Figure 2F of Vazey et al., 2018), and they found that in layers 5 and 6, short latency transient responses to foot touch were potentiated and recruited by simultaneous LC stimulation. While this finding appears more overt than the small modulations we see, it is qualitatively not so dissimilar from our finding that transient responses appear to be slightly potentiated when visual flow begins (<a href=\"#sa3fig2\">Author response image 2</a>). Differences in the degree of the effect may be due to differences in the layers recorded, the proportion of the LC recruited, or the fact anesthesia was used in Vazey et al., 2018.",

We therefore believe that these enhanced transients at visual flow onset could be due to the effect of ChrimsonR stimulation, and indeed previous studies have shown that LC stimulation can reduce the onset latency and latency jitter of afferent-evoked activity (Devilbiss and Waterhouse, 2004; Lecas, 2004), an effect which could mediate the differences we see.

It is not clear over which time scale the locomotion modulation index changes and how many optogenetic stimulations are necessary or sufficient to saturate this index. Some of these questions could be addressed with the dataset of Figure 3 by measuring this index over different epochs of the imaging session (from early to late) to estimate the dynamics of the ongoing plasticity process (in comparison to control mice). Also, is there any behavioural consequence of plasticity/update of functional representation in V1? If plasticity gated by repeated LC activations reproduced visuomotor responses observed in mice that were exposed to visual stimulation only in the virtual environment, then I would expect to see a change in the locomotion behaviour (such as a change in speed distribution) as a result of the repeated LC stimulation. This would provide more compelling evidence for changes in internal models for visuomotor coupling in relation to its behavioural relevance. An experiment that could confirm the existence of the LC-gated learning process would be to change the gain of the visuomotor coupling and see if mice adapt faster with LC optogenetic activation compared to control mice with no ChrimsonR expression. Authors should discuss how they imagine the behavioural manifestation of this artificially-induced learning process in V1.",

This is because in the first 10 minutes, the mouse is in closed loop visuomotor VR experience, undergoing optogenetic stimulation (this is the time period in which we record mismatches). We then shift to the open loop session to quantify the effect of optogenetic stimulation on visual flow responses. Since the plasticity is presumably happening during the closed loop phase, and we have no read-out of the plasticity during this phase (we do not have uncoupled visual flow onsets to quantify LMI in closed loop), it is not possible to track the plasticity over time.",

Intuitive purposes of this type of plasticity would be (1) to enable better detection of external moving objects by suppressing the predictable (and therefore redundant) self-generated visual motion and (2) to better detect changes in the geometry of the world (near objects have a larger visuomotor gain that far objects). In our paradigm, we have no intuitive read-out of the mouse’s perception of these things, and it is not clear to us that they would be reflected in locomotion speed, which does not differ between groups (manuscript Figure S5). Instead, we would need to turn to other paradigms for a clear behavioral read-out of predictive forms of sensorimotor learning: for instance, sensorimotor learning paradigms in the VR (such as those used in (Heindorf et al., 2018; Leinweber et al., 2017)), or novel paradigms that reinforce the mouse for detecting changes in the gain of the VR, or moving objects in the VR, using LC stimulation during the learning phase to assess if this improves acquisition. This is certainly a direction for future work. In the case of a positive effect, however, the link between the precise form of plasticity we quantify in this manuscript and the effect on the behavior would remain indirect, so we see this as beyond the scope of the manuscript.

Using genetic tools to selectively label LC neurons in mice and in vivo imaging of LC axonal calcium responses in the V1 and motor cortex in awake mice in virtual reality training, they showed that LC axons responded selectively to a mismatch between the visual input and locomotion. The greater the mismatch (the faster the locomotion in relation to the visual input), the larger the LC response. This seemed to be a global response as LC responses were indistinguishable between sensory and motor cortical areas. They further showed that LC drove learning (updating the internal model) despite that LC optical stimulation failed to alter acute cellular responses. Responses in the visual cortex increased with locomotion, and this was suppressed following LC phasic stimulation during visuomotor coupled training (closed loop). In the last section, they showed that artificial optogenetic stimulation of LC permitted plasticity over minutes, which would normally take days in non-stimulated mice trained in the visuomotor coupling mode. These data enhance our understanding of LC functionality in vivo and support the framework that LC acts as a prediction error detector and supervises cortical plasticity to update internal representations.",

The authors hypothesized that norepinephrine released by Locus Coeruleus (LC) neurons in cortical circuits gates the plasticity of internal models following visuomotor prediction errors. To test this hypothesis, they devised clever experiments that allowed them to manipulate visual flow with respect to locomotion to create prediction errors in visuomotor coupling and measure the related signals in LC axons innervating the cortex using two-photon calcium imaging. They observed calcium responses proportional to absolute prediction errors that were non-specifically broadcast across the dorsal cortex. To understand how these signals contribute to computations performed by V1 neurons in layers 2/3, the authors activated LC noradrenergic inputs using optogenetic stimulations while imaging calcium responses in cortical neurons. Although LC activation had little impact on evoked activity related to visuomotor prediction errors, the authors observed changes in the effect of locomotion on visually evoked activity after repeated LC axons activation that were absent in control mice. Using a clever paradigm where the locomotion modulation index was measured in the same neurons before and after optogenetic manipulations, they confirmed that this plasticity depended on the density of LC axons activated, the visual flow associated with running, and the concurrent visuomotor coupling during LC activation. Based on similar locomotion modulation index dependency on speed observed in mice that develop only with visuomotor experience in the virtual environment, the authors concluded that changes in locomotion modulation index are the result of experience-dependent plasticity occurring at a much faster rate during LC axons optogenetic stimulations.",
