Here, using tiling-sgRNA CRISPR screens, we report that each subunit of ORC and CDC6 is essential in human cells. Using an auxin-inducible degradation system, we created stable cell lines capable of ablating ORC2 rapidly, revealing multiple cell division cycle phenotypes. The primary defects in the absence of ORC2 were cells encountering difficulty in initiating DNA replication or progressing through the cell division cycle due to reduced MCM2-7 loading onto chromatin in G1 phase. The nuclei of ORC2 deficient cells were also large, with decompacted heterochromatin. Some ORC2 deficient cells that completed DNA replication entered into, but never exited mitosis. ORC1 knockout cells also demonstrated extremely slow cell proliferation and abnormal cell and nuclear morphology. Thus, ORC proteins and CDC6 are indispensable for normal cellular proliferation and contribute to nuclear organization.",

Here, using tiling-sgRNA CRISPR screens, we report that each subunit of ORC and CDC6 is essential in human cells. Using an auxin-inducible degradation system, we created stable cell lines capable of ablating ORC2 rapidly, revealing multiple cell division cycle phenotypes. The primary defects in the absence of ORC2 were cells encountering difficulty in initiating DNA replication or progressing through the cell division cycle due to reduced MCM2-7 loading onto chromatin in G1 phase. The nuclei of ORC2-deficient cells were also large, with decompacted heterochromatin. Some ORC2-deficient cells that completed DNA replication entered into, but never exited mitosis. ORC1 knockout cells also demonstrated extremely slow cell proliferation and abnormal cell and nuclear morphology. Thus, ORC proteins and CDC6 are indispensable for normal cellular proliferation and contribute to nuclear organization.",

To ensure complete and correct duplication of genomes, the initiation of DNA replication is highly regulated and begins with the assembly of a pre-Replication Complex (pre-RC) at origins of DNA replication throughout the genome (<a href=\"#bib15\">Bell and Labib, 2016</a>). Among eukaryotes, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> is the best characterized system, from which individual proteins involved in DNA replication have been identified and studied extensively, including functional reconstitution of the entire pre-RC assembly and the regulated initiation of DNA replication from these pre-RCs with purified proteins (<a href=\"#bib36\">Evrin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib101\">Remus et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib130\">Yeeles et al., 2015</a>). In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, pre-RC assembly begins with the origin recognition complex (ORC), comprising Orc1-6 subunits, binding to each potential DNA replication origin (<a href=\"#bib13\">Bell et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Bell and Labib, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Bell and Stillman, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Gibson et al., 2006</a>). Chromatin-bound ORC then provides a platform for the assembly and recruitment of other pre-RC proteins. Cdc6 binds to ORC, followed by the binding of Cdt1-Mcm2-7 to form head-to-head Mcm2-7 double hexamers to complete the formation of the pre-RC (<a href=\"#bib7\">Araki, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Bell and Labib, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Bleichert et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Evrin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Heller et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib101\">Remus et al., 2009</a>). The Mcm2-7 double hexamer helicase precursor complex remains bound to DNA in an inactive state until it is activated by additional proteins and protein kinases (<a href=\"#bib15\">Bell and Labib, 2016</a>). During S phase, cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) and the Cdc7-Dbf4-dependent protein kinase (DDK), Sld2, Mcm10, Dpb11, Sld3/7, DNA polymerase ε, Cdc45 and the GINS complex are recruited to activate MCM2-7 helicase (<a href=\"#bib8\">Araki, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Araki et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Bell and Labib, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Kamimura et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Kamimura et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib117\">Takayama et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib130\">Yeeles et al., 2015</a>). The functional helicase consists of Cdc45-Mcm2-7-GINS (CMG) and when activated it unwinds the DNA in a bidirectional and temporally regulated manner from each origin (<a href=\"#bib19\">Bleichert et al., 2017</a>).",

ORC binds to A and B1 DNA sequence elements within the autonomously replicating sequence (ARS), which contains a conserved ARS consensus sequence (ACS) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Bell and Labib, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Bell and Stillman, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Celniker et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Deshpande and Newlon, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Marahrens and Stillman, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib100\">Rao and Stillman, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib103\">Rowley et al., 1995</a>). On the other hand, in human cells, there is no apparent sequence-specific binding of ORC to DNA, and the binding of ORC to chromosomes is dynamic (<a href=\"#bib124\">Vashee et al., 2001</a>). ORC subunits do, however, localize to specific sites within the chromosome, most likely via interactions with modified histones or other chromatin-interacting proteins (<a href=\"#bib49\">Higa et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Hossain and Stillman, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Kuo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Long et al., 2019</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Miotto et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib119\">Tatsumi et al., 2008</a>). One or more of the human ORC subunits dissociate from the complex soon after the pre-RC is formed. For example, in human cells ORC1 is ubiquitinated by the SCF<sup>skp2</sup> ubiquitin ligase and is degraded during the G1-S transition and early S phase, and then re-appears as cells enter mitosis (<a href=\"#bib63\">Kara et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Kreitz et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Méndez et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Ohta et al., 2003</a>).

Evaluation of CRISPR knock-out (CRISPR-KO) strategies have shown that targeting regions within protein domains typically show significantly higher degree of negative selection phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib46\">He et al., 2019</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Hsu et al., 2018</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Montalbano et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Munoz et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib107\">Shi et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib126\">Wang et al., 2019</a>). This is because both frameshift and more crucially in-frame mutations within functionally active regions of a protein result in genetic nulls (<a href=\"#bib85\">Munoz et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib107\">Shi et al., 2015</a>). Off-target effects notwithstanding, targeting known domains that contribute to protein function have informed the design of pooled whole-genome CRISPR screens like GeCKO and Avana. Similarly, applying CRISPR-KO strategies to individual proteins requires selection of a single or a few sgRNAs that target known functional domains and have a considerably low off-target score. However, at least in the case of ORC, CRISPR-based ablation of individual subunits of the complex have reported different phenotypic outcomes. For example, in DepMap, the database that summarizes results from whole-genome CRISPR screens (GeCKO 19Q1 and Avana 20Q2 libraries) (<a href=\"#bib81\">Meyers et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib123\">Tsherniak et al., 2017</a>), <i>ORC1</i> is listed as a common essential gene while <i>ORC2</i> is listed as non-essential in tested cell types (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</a>). Other members of the pre-RC proteins – <i>ORC3</i>, <i>ORC4</i>, <i>CDC6</i>, <i>MCM2-7</i>, and <i>CDT1</i> show variability between GeCKO and Avana screens in being described as common essential or not. In 2015, <i>ORC1</i>, <i>ORC4</i>, and <i>MCM4</i> were reported as essential in murine cells by using guides that targeted the AAA+ or WH domains of the proteins (<a href=\"#bib107\">Shi et al., 2015</a>). Subsequently, in human colorectal carcinoma cell line HCT116, <i>ORC1</i>, and <i>ORC2</i> were reported to be non-essential for cell proliferation (<a href=\"#bib108\">Shibata et al., 2016</a>).",

                                    "text": "The rationale for using a pooled tiling-sgRNA CRISPR screen approach was – (a) since essential protein domains correlate with higher negative selection phenotype, we hypothesized that analyzing the effect of every possible guide RNA target site in the ORF might uncover new functional regions, and (b) a high-throughput screen of this nature would provide incontrovertible evidence about the essentiality of ORC and CDC6 proteins, at least in the cell lines tested. A recent study validated this approach by analyzing tiling-sgRNA data from Munoz et. al. and found that up to 17.7% of the regions that displayed a CRISPR knockout hyper-sensitive (CKHS) phenotype, did not overlap with previously annotated domain or known function (<a href=\"#bib46\">He et al., 2019</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Munoz et al., 2016</a>). Thus, guide RNAs targeting every possible PAM sequence 5′-NGG-3′ (<i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> Cas9) across each exon of <i>ORC1-6</i> and <i>CDC6</i> were designed and synthesized. Pooled CRISPR libraries also included control guide RNAs targeting either known core essential genes such as <i>CDK1</i>, <i>PCNA</i> etc. as positive controls, or those targeting non-essential gene loci or no loci at all as negative controls (<a href=\"#bib82\">Miles et al., 2016</a>). The total library comprised 882 guides targeting <i>ORC1-6</i> and <i>CDC6</i>, 1602 negative controls (Used in GeCKO V2 library - ‘NeGeCKO’ (<a href=\"#bib104\">Sanjana et al., 2014</a>), negative controls used in The Sabatini/Lander CRISPR pooled library (<a href=\"#bib94\">Park et al., 2017</a>), <i>Rosa26</i>, CSHL in-house negatives (<a href=\"#bib74\">Lu et al., 2018</a>; <a href=\"#bib118\">Tarumoto et al., 2018</a>) and 43 positive controls; with a median of three pre-validated guides targeting known essential genes <i>CDK1</i>, <i>CDK9</i>, <i>RPL9</i>, <i>PCNA</i> etc; <a href=\"#supp1\">Supplementary file 1</a>_guides). Parallel screens were done in the colorectal cancer derived HCT116-Cas9 cells and human diploid RPE-1-Cas9 cells and the relative depletions of guide RNAs in the cell populations between Day 3 and Day 21 were compared using the guide read counts generated by Illumina based next-generation sequencing (n = 2 for HCT116, n = 1 for RPE-1) and the data was analyzed with MAGeCK (<a href=\"#bib68\">Li et al., 2014</a>). The screens performed well as shown by the consistent log fold change (LFC) pattern of depletion or relative enrichment of positive and negative controls, respectively – although the absolute values and the range of LFCs were cell-line specific. The LFC threshold of ‘essentiality’ for each cell line was set at the value at which a guide RNA was depleted more than every negative control as well as ≥ to the median depletion of guides targeting each positive control (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b–d</a>, red line). In HCT116, LFC ≤ −1 and LFC ≤ −5 in RPE-1 were found to be the cut-off for log fold depletion.",

It is evident that the method of choice did have a bearing on the phenotypic outcome of the knock-down. The study by <a href=\"#bib108\">Shibata et al., 2016</a> that found <i>ORC1</i> and <i>ORC2</i> to be non-essential also used CRISPR editing as the method of knock-down, but also performed long-term selection for cell proliferation to obtain <i>ORC1<sup>-/-</sup></i> of <i>ORC2<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells. We therefore determined if our screen had guide RNAs that were used in either of the DepMap dataset or used in the directed study (<a href=\"#bib108\">Shibata et al., 2016</a>). For <i>ORC1</i> and <i>ORC2</i> sgRNAs that were used in DepMap datasets, there was a variation in their phenotype as measured by LFC values, with some guides classifying <i>ORC1</i> and <i>ORC2</i> as essential and others not (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a–c</a>). Of note is the fact that the guide used to target <i>ORC2</i> in the <a href=\"#bib108\">Shibata et al., 2016</a> study showed activity very close to the cut-off in HCT116 cells and scored as non-essential in RPE-1. It is important to note that when a guide targeting a relatively non-essential region allows for the cells to proliferate, no conclusion can be made about the protein being essential. The <a href=\"#bib108\">Shibata et al., 2016</a> study used that single guide to insert a gene encoding blasticidin resistance and a poly A cassette into the locus, with the aim of disrupting transcription, while our single-guide-per-locus type of screen did not introduce such large insertions. We find that <i>ORC1-6</i> and <i>CDC6</i> are all essential in both cell lines tested, and that the dynamic range of depletion of these proteins was greater in diploid RPE-1 cells (<a href=\"#fig2s7\">Figure 2—figure supplement 7a</a>). Comparison of the results from our screens and the published DepMap, especially about <i>ORC2</i>, suggest that using too few guides to target proteins can lead to artifactual observations both in terms of essentiality or non-essentiality, and that overall, the gene-effect is influenced by the combination of the choice of guide RNA and the cell line studied.",

This finding is consistent with the only previous study that used tiling-sgRNA negative CRISPR screens (<a href=\"#bib85\">Munoz et al., 2016</a>). Moreover, we see a high correlation between our datasets from both HCT116 replicates (r ≈ 0.7) as well as between HCT116 and RPE-1 (r ≈ 0.47), which is also consistent with the previous study that compared three cell lines (<a href=\"#fig2s7\">Figure 2—figure supplement 7b</a>). For each ORC subunit (and CDC6), ≥50% of designed sgRNAs target annotated domain (AD) regions (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2—figure supplement 6a</a>), with the exception of <i>ORC4</i>, which is entirely structured, and thus none of the sgRNAs target NAD regions. For all other genes, the fraction of NAD targeting sgRNAs that scored as essential, as well as their locations within these regions were comparable between cell lines rather than between proteins (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2—figure supplement 6b–h</a>). This suggests there are functional modules within the NADs and indeed, at least in some cases, we found that sgRNA dropouts in our screens agree with recent functional studies about these regions. For example, in <i>ORC1</i>, in HCT116 we saw depletion of sgRNAs targeting regions between 300–450 aa. In humans and <i>Drosophila</i>, this N-terminal region is an unstructured IDR, required for ATP-independent chromatin recruitment of ORC and drives protein phase-separation with DNA in vitro (<a href=\"#bib20\">Bleichert et al., 2018</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Hossain et al., 2019</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Parker et al., 2019</a>). In yeast, this region of Orc1 has been shown to be critical for interacting with ARS DNA as well, but is completely structured unlike metazoan ORC1 (<a href=\"#bib56\">Hu et al., 2020</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Kawakami et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Li et al., 2018</a>). Another example is ORC6 in which the N-terminus harbors a structured TFIIB domain, but we noticed sgRNA depletions in the remaining regions, especially the C-terminal extremity, which is a septin-binding-region essential for cytokinesis and mutations in a conserved C-terminal motif have also been linked to Meier-Gorlin Syndrome (<a href=\"#bib3\">Akhmetova et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Balasov et al., 2020</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Balasov et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Balasov et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Bicknell et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Prasanth et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib129\">Xu et al., 2020</a>).",

To determine similarities or differences in ‘regions of essentiality’ in ORC and CDC6 between HCT116 and RPE-1 cell lines, we used the computational tool Protiler, developed specifically for tiling-sgRNA CRISPR screens (<a href=\"#bib46\">He et al., 2019</a>). This tool takes into account local outliers due to inactive sgRNA or additive effects, and maps sgRNA depletion signals to amino acids of the target proteins to identify functionally essential regions based on their CRISPR-knockout hyper-sensitivity (CKHS). MAGeCK LFC values for combined HCT116 replicates and RPE-1 were put through this pipeline at two different -t2/--thresholds, 0.25 and 0.5, which detect changing points using the TGUH method described in this study. Almost all annotated domains or their boundaries overlapped with CKHS regions (<a href=\"#fig2s8\">Figure 2—figure supplements 8</a>–<a href=\"#fig2s13\">13</a>). In addition, in ORC1, ORC2, ORC3, ORC6, and CDC6 NAD regions were also determined to be CKHS.

These phenotypes can be outcomes of accumulated errors that happen during any phase of the cell cycle and thus it is hard to distinguish between primary and secondary phenotypes associated with the loss of ORC2. Therefore, we used CRISPR/Cas9 in combination with an auxin inducible degron (mAID) tagged ORC2 to construct cell lines in which endogenous ORC2 could be knocked out by CRISPR, and the complementing CRISPR-resistant mAID-ORC2 could then be rapidly removed from cells, allowing exploration of the importance of ORC2 at different stages of cell division cycle (<a href=\"#bib86\">Natsume et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Nishimura et al., 2009</a>). To mediate the endogenous ORC2 knockout, four sgRNAs, hereafter named ORC2-1, ORC2-2, ORC2-3, and ORC2-4, were selected for on-target single guide validation. For complementation, N-terminally tagged mAID-sgRNA resistant ORC2 (mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup>) was constructed, and the <i>ORC2</i> cDNA was edited to harbor multiple mismatches based on two of the four sgRNAs, ORC2-1 and ORC2-2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>). To perform ORC2 depletion or genetic complementation, mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup> constructs were transduced into two cell lines, TO-HCT116 cell line, which expresses a doxycycline-inducible <i>Oryza sativa</i> (Asian rice) <i>TIR1</i> (OsTIR1) gene that encodes a plant auxin‐binding receptor that interacts with the conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF complex to degrade mAID-tagged proteins and the U2OS cell line. In the dropout CRISPR/Cas9 experiment, cells expressing a positive control RPA3 sgRNA and all four ORC2 sgRNAs, but not the negative control Neg15 sgRNA (CSHL in-house negatives, <a href=\"#supp1\">Supplementary file 1</a>), showed depletion over 3 weeks of cell culture (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e,f</a>).

Sequencing of the target sites showed that the ORC2_H-1 and H-3 cell lines had heterozygous mutations at the sgRNA targeting site which led to premature stop codons downstream of the target site (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</a>). On the other hand, the H-2, H-4, and H-5 cell lines were homozygous with an identical two-nucleotide-deletion, creating a nonsense mutation at the sgRNA targeting site. Although the ORC2-1 sgRNA targets the C-terminus of ORC2, no truncated form of protein was detected by western blot. Our ORC2 rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against the N-terminal half of ORC2 protein. The LTR-driven mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup> protein expressed at lower levels compared to endogenous ORC2 in TO-HCT116, RPE-1 and IMR90 cells, but was sufficient to complement the loss of endogenous ORC2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>).",

We excluded off-target effects by confirming the ORC2_H-2 cell line was resistant to both ORC2-1 and ORC2-2 sgRNAs, but not to the ORC2-3 and ORC2-4 sgRNAs (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</a>). Compared with parental TO-HCT116 cell line, the human diploid cell RPE-1 expressed ~ 50% less ORC2, while IMR-90 cells expressed ~ 75% less (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). The relative levels of ORC3 reflect the levels of ORC2 since they are known to form a cognate complex throughout the cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib34\">Dhar et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Jaremko et al., 2020</a>; <a href=\"#bib124\">Vashee et al., 2001</a>). ORC2_H-2, H-4, and H-5 cells had no detectable endogenous ORC2, and ORC3 showed stoichiometrically comparable expression to mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup> levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). In addition, ORC2_H-2 cells expressed mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup> at only about 5% that of endogenous ORC2 levels in TO-HCT116, while H-4 and H-5 cells expressed marginally more at about 10%.

When doxycycline was added to induce OsTIR1 expression, proliferation of all cell lines decreased by similar rates, possibly either due to some toxicity to doxycycline or the expression of OsTIR1 protein itself (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>). It is important to note that auxin alone did not affect the proliferation rate of wild type TO-HCT116, H-4, and H-5 cells, but it reduced the proliferation rate of H-2 cells substantially (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). This phenotype was probably caused by the leaky expression of Tet-OsTIR1 in ORC2_H-2 cells. Finally, when both doxycycline and auxin were added, all three ORC2 KO cell lines stopped proliferating entirely, whereas the parental TO-HCT116 cells continued to proliferate (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>).",

At the 50 hr time point, all three ORC2 KO cell lines had less cells progressing from G1 into S phase, and more cells accumulated in late S phase or the G2/M phase (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3f</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</a>). Cells with a 4C DNA peak (late S/G2/M phase) continued to incorporate EdU, suggesting that DNA replication was not complete, even though the bulk of the genome was duplicated.

CHK1 is essential for the DNA damage response and the G2/M checkpoint arrest and is primarily phosphorylated by ATR, although phosphorylation by ATM has also been reported (<a href=\"#bib40\">Gatei et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Goto et al., 2019</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Jackson et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Liu et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib128\">Wilsker et al., 2008</a>). ORC3 and mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup> proteins in ORC2_H-2, H-4, and H-5 cell lines were depleted following 4 hr of auxin treatment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3g</a>). A nonspecific smaller band was detected but this band did not co-immunoprecipitate with ORC3 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</a>). When no auxin was added, ORC1 levels in all four cell lines were similar, but the level gradually decreased after mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup> depletion, which could be an effect of the phase in which cells ultimately arrest at the 50 hr time point (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3—figure supplement 3b</a>). On the other hand, CDC6 protein level increased 1.3- to 1.7-fold in mutant cell lines at 0 hr time point, indicating cells might favor higher CDC6 level when ORC is low (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3—figure supplement 3c</a>). Phosphorylation of ATM(S1981), ATR(T1989), and CHK1(S345) were detected in H-2, H-4, and H-5 cell lines after 50 hr of auxin treatment, but not in the parental TO-HCT116 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3g</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3—figure supplement 3a</a>). Higher levels of P-γH2AX(S139) in H-2, H-4, and H-5 cells were detected even when no auxin was added (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3g</a>). This showed that although cells can divide with only 5–10% of ORC2, a certain degree of replication stress exists. In our experiments, when parental and ORC2 mutant cells were treated with doxycycline and auxin, phospho-CHK2(T68) level increased slightly in all four cell lines, suggesting the phosphorylation could be associated with the drug treatment but not depletion of mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup> itself. These observations were also supported by results from immunofluorescent staining of individual cells. When cells were treated with doxycycline and auxin for 48 hr, substantially more ATM(S1981) and CHK1(S345) phosphorylation were detected in all three ORC2 mutant cell lines (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3h,i</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3—figure supplement 3d–e</a>). In the absence of doxycycline and auxin, the P-γH2AX(S139) signal was more abundant in ORC2_H-2, H-4, and H-5 cells than in wild type (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3—figure supplement 3f</a>). To conclude, insufficient ORC2 protein in cells resulted in abnormal DNA replication and DNA damage, and in response to DNA damage, CHK1 was activated and cells arrested in G2 phase.",

The average volume of nuclei was greater than the volume of the largest parental cells, and thus the large nuclear phenotype could not be explained by their arrest in G2 phase with a 4C DNA content. However, since ORC2 depletion using siRNA decondenses centromere-associated α-satellite DNA (<a href=\"#bib99\">Prasanth et al., 2010</a>), this phenotype could be due to cells arrested in late S and G2 phase with decompacted heterochromatin. During interphase, ORC2 and ORC3 localize to the heterochromatin foci and interact with heterochromatin protein 1α (HP1α) through ORC3 (<a href=\"#bib92\">Pak et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Pflumm and Botchan, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Prasanth et al., 2004</a>). To detect heterochromatin decompaction, immunofluorescent staining of the centromeric protein C (CENP-C) and HP1α was performed. In TO-HCT116 cells, CENP-C staining showed multiple, compact foci, but in the doxycycline and auxin treated cells that were dependent on mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup>, CENP-C foci were larger and more prominent (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a–b</a>). In doxycycline-treated control TO-HCT116, ORC2_H-2, and ORC2_H-5 cells, normal HP1α foci were observed and most of them localized adjacent to the CENP-C foci. However, in the doxycycline and auxin treated ORC2 mutant cells, HP1α foci were decompacted, shown by an expanded pattern of staining rather than discrete foci found in the parental cells (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4—figure supplement 2a–f</a>). This phenotype was observed in cells that also showed the large CENP-C foci phenotype. HP1α is involved in phase separation of heterochromatin (<a href=\"#bib67\">Larson et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib115\">Strom et al., 2017</a>), and removing ORC (ORC2 in this case) from the heterochromatin might affect the overall compaction. These HP1α fluorescence patterns were different from those previously observed when ORC was removed using an siRNA approach in HeLa cells (<a href=\"#bib99\">Prasanth et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Prasanth et al., 2004</a>). This difference is most likely because HeLa, being hyper tetraploid cells, have a different nuclear organization of HP1α compared to that found in HCT116 cells. HeLa cell HP1α foci are more intense and discrete and colocalize with CENP-C (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4—figure supplement 2g</a>).",

TO-HCT116 and ORC2_H-2 cells were incubated with Palbociclib and doxycycline for 28 hr, with auxin added during the last 4.5 hr in G1 phase, then cells were harvested after a further 12 hr incubation (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4—figure supplement 3a</a>). The second harvest time point was 40 hr after Palbociclib treatment and 16.5 hr after auxin treatment. The nuclear volume was determined, and we found that it remained unchanged in both cell types (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4—figure supplement 3b</a>). CENP-C and HP1α staining was also unaffected (data not shown). Thus, loss of ORC2 in G1 phase did not induce nuclear chromatin decompaction. One possibility is that the absence of ORC2 during S phase affects sister chromatid cohesion loading (<a href=\"#bib131\">Zheng et al., 2018</a>), which leads to decompaction of centromeric and heterochromatin regions in late S/G2 phase.",

To examine the role of ORC2 in G1 and mitosis following acute depletion, TO-HCT116 and the ORC2_H-2 cells were synchronized at the G1-early S phase boundary with a 2C DNA content by a double thymidine block, with doxycycline being added during the second thymidine block.

During the second cell cycle, however, doxycycline and auxin-treated TO-HCT116 cells progressed through S phase only slightly slower than the untreated cells. By contrast, starting from the second cell cycle, serious defects were observed in ORC2_H-2 auxin-treated cells compared to untreated cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b–c</a>). First, auxin-treated ORC2_H-2 cells exhibited a very slow S phase, indicating that cells were struggling to completely replicate their DNA. Second, cells arrested with a 4C DNA content, which could either be late S or G2/M phase. Third, after 48 hr following release from the double thymidine block, some cells arrested in G1 phase and could not enter S phase. We suggest that in the first cell cycle, although mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup> was depleted just before release, the pre-RCs were already formed and the cells were primed to replicate the complete genome. However, starting from the second cell cycle, since ORC2 was entirely lost from cells following cell cycle progression through the previous S, G2 and M phase, the cells began to accrue cell cycle defects. Most ORC2-depleted cells then either arrested in G1 or went through an incomplete S phase and arrested at the G2/M phase, but did not progress further. This experiment indicated ORC2 primarily functions in establishing DNA replication initiation, but based on the results thus far, we could not conclude a role during mitosis because in the first cycle ORC2 depleted cells with a 4C DNA content, progressed through G2/M phase and cell division into the next G1.",

To test this hypothesis, the chromatin-bound MCM2-7 was measured in asynchronous cells by flow cytometry following extraction by detergents as described previously (<a href=\"#bib76\">Matson et al., 2017</a>). Asynchronous TO-HCT116, ORC2_H-2, and H-5 cells, with or without doxycycline and auxin treatment, were pulse-labeled with EdU, harvested and stained with anti-MCM2 antibody and DNA dye. In normal medium and without detergent extraction, nearly 100% of the cells were positive for MCM2 in all three cell lines (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6—figure supplement 1b</a>). When extracted with detergent, about 78% of TO-HCT116, 65.2% of ORC2_H-2, and 76.9% of ORC2_H-5 cells were positive for MCM2. Chromatin-bound MCM2 level was not affected in untreated or doxycycline-treated TO-HCT116 and ORC2 mutant cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>). When treated with both doxycycline and auxin for 20 hr, chromatin-bound MCM2 levels decreased significantly in mutant cells, especially in the ORC2-H-2 cell line (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a,c</a>). Focusing on the G1 population, 93.7% of TO-HCT116 cells, 80.4% of ORC2_H-2 cells, and 89.3% of ORC2_H-5 cells were positive for MCM2 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>) in untreated cells. When doxycycline was added, MCM2 level in ORC2 H-2 cells dropped slightly to 62.2%, while the other two cell lines remained at similar level, 96.8% in TO-HCT116% and 82.5% in ORC2_H-5 cells. When treated with both doxycycline and auxin, 97.5% of TO-HCT116 G1 phase cells stained for chromatin-bound MCM2, but this decreased to only 4.6% and 22.4% cells in ORC2_H-2 and ORC2_H-5 G1 phase cells, respectively. Importantly, the doxycycline and auxin treated ORC2_H-2 and ORC2 H-5 G1 phase cells had very low levels of MCM2 compared to the MCM2 levels in cells that did not receive auxin (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>). The different degrees of reduction in MCM2 loading between doxycycline and auxin treated H-2 and H-5 cells reflected the relative levels of mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup>. Therefore, ORC2 depletion prevented MCM2 loading onto G1 phase chromatin.",

In the untreated asynchronous population, about 4.53 ± 0.59% and 1.57 ± 0.33% were pH3S10-positive in TO-HCT116 and ORC2_H-2 cells respectively, while 31.4 ± 2.88% of TO-HCT116 cells and 15.6 ± 1.25% of ORC2_H-2 cells were at G2/M.

To observe mitotic phenotypes and mitotic progression following ORC2 depletion, we constitutively expressed H2B-mCherry in TO-HCT116 and ORC2_H-2 cells via lentiviral transduction and performed time lapse fluorescent imaging of the mitotic chromosomes. Cells were synchronized using a single thymidine block and auxin was added or omitted 2 hr before releasing into fresh medium with or without doxycycline and auxin. As expected, in either treated or untreated TO-HCT116 cells, the first cell cycle after release from the thymidine block was normal and cells progressed through mitosis into the second cell cycle (data not shown). During the second cell cycle, in the absence or presence of doxycycline and auxin, it took TO-HCT116 cells about 35–50 min to progress from early prophase to chromosome segregation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b and c</a>, n = 10 for each). In the absence of doxycycline and auxin, ORC2_H-2 cells also progressed through mitosis like the parental cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7d</a>, n = 10). In stark contrast, in presence of doxycycline and auxin ORC2_H-2 cells showed condensed chromatin and attempted to congress chromosomes at the metaphase plate but never achieved correct metaphase alignment of chromosomes even after 6–13 hr (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7e</a>, n = 5). Those few cells that did attempt anaphase had abnormal chromosome segregation, producing lagging chromosomes, micronuclei and became apoptotic.",

We obtained the <i>ORC1<sup>-/-</sup></i> (B14 clone) and <i>ORC2<sup>-/-</sup></i> (P44 clone) cell lines described in this study as a gift from Dr. Anindya Dutta and performed several experiments on them. Using the ORC2 validated sgRNAs (different target site from Shibata et al.), we first tested if the <i>ORC2<sup>-/-</sup></i> cell line was sensitivity to the four <i>ORC2</i> sgRNAs we used in our study (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>). The negative-selection GFP depletion assay surprisingly showed that both the parental HCT116 <i>p53<sup>-/-</sup></i> and the <i>ORC2<sup>-/-</sup></i> cell line were sensitive to CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of <i>ORC2</i> compared to control sgRNA (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8a–b</a>). More importantly, when both cell lines were transduced to express mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup> that was resistant to the ORC2-1 and ORC2-2 sgRNAs, this effect was rescued in HCT116 <i>p53<sup>-/-</sup></i> and to a slightly lesser extent in <i>ORC2<sup>-/-</sup></i> cell line (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8c–d</a>). This suggested that there may be some form of functional ORC2 in the <i>ORC2<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells that was being targeted by the tested sgRNAs. In addition, an immunoblot of the cell lysates showed a reduced level of ORC3 in the <i>ORC2<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8—figure supplement 1a</a>), and since ORC2 and ORC3 form stable heterodimers in cells, this result again indicated that some form of ORC2 was expressed in cells, albeit at a lower level. When immunoprecipitated with an antibody against ORC3, we detected ORC3 and a putative truncated form of ORC2 which was seen only in <i>ORC2<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8—figure supplement 1b</a>). Next, we designed primer pairs that span exon junctions for each exon in <i>ORC2</i> and performed quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) to determine the nature of the <i>ORC2</i> transcripts in the <i>ORC2<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8e</a>). The calculated fold change (FC) indicated that in the <i>ORC2<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells, about 60% of the mRNAs had exon seven skipped, whereas other exons remained the same (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8e</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</a>).",

To determine the CNV status we performed SMASH (<a href=\"#bib125\">Wang et al., 2016</a>) analysis on the two parental HCT116 cell lines with the <i>p53<sup>+/+</sup></i> and <i>p53<sup>-/-</sup></i> background as well as the Shibata et al. <i>ORC1<sup>-/-</sup></i> and <i>ORC2<sup>-/-</sup></i> deficient lines. Both the parental cell lines showed very similar chromosome copy number, characteristic of HCT116, while both <i>ORC1</i> deficient and <i>ORC2</i>-deficient cell lines had additional CNVs in chromosomes unrelated to those harboring either <i>ORC1</i> or <i>ORC2</i> (<a href=\"#fig8s3\">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</a>). The significance of these specific loci which showed alterations in copy number when either <i>ORC1</i> or <i>ORC2</i> was deleted remains to be investigated. However, it was in this analysis that we noticed that in <i>ORC2<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells a part of the <i>ORC2</i> gene locus that was hugely amplified (<a href=\"#fig8s3\">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</a> solid arrow). To study in detail the <i>ORC2</i> gene region on chromosome two in these cells, we performed long-read Oxford Nanopore sequencing analysis. Compared to the reference allele sequence, <i>ORC2<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells showed highly mutated and heterogenous allele distribution near the CRISPR targeting site used in the Shibata et al. study (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8f</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s4\">Figure 8—figure supplement 4</a>). In addition, this <i>ORC2<sup>-/-</sup></i> cell line contained many copies of the plasmid with ORC2 homology arms, used for integration of a disruptive blasticidin cassette into the ORC2 gene locus (<a href=\"#bib108\">Shibata et al., 2016</a>). In fact, it was the <i>ORC2</i> homology arms in the plasmid that showed up as the massive amplification in the CNV analysis by SMASH (<a href=\"#fig8s4\">Figure 8—figure supplement 4a,b,c</a>). Based on RT-PCR data, aside from the expected heterozygous deletions in exon 7, exon 4 also exhibited multiple heterozygous SNPs at three different sites. Among them, SNP1 resulted in a novel stop codon, while SNP3/4/5 were missense mutations, and SNP2/6 were silent mutations (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8f</a>). Next, we determined the haplotype phasing information between the heterozygous exon 7 deletion and the potential novel stop codons. One allele of ORC2 contained various mutations in exon 4, in combination with the deleted exon 7, showing that the cell line was heterogeneous to start with. The other allele of <i>ORC2</i> that had an intact exon seven also had either wild type or SNPs in exon 4. Since there is a methionine in exon 5, it is possible the truncated ORC2 protein we observed was translated from this internal start site (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8—figure supplement 1b</a>). Although substantially altered, based on the sequencing data and the sensitivity of the cells to ORC2-1 and ORC2-2 sgRNAs, we conclude that the cell strain is not a true <i>ORC2</i> knockout.",

When probed further by staining for F-actin and Lamin B1 to observe overall cellular morphology and nuclear membrane integrity respectively, we observed that despite the staining for DNA content looking normal, up to 50% of the <i>ORC1<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells showed highly abnormal, involuted nuclear membranes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8i</a>).

About 35% of <i>ORC1<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells were grossly larger than wild type cells. Those multinucleate/polyploid giant cells were full of membrane invagination and vacuoles, and also exhibit significant apoptotic activities. Most likely they were formed due to extensive DNA damage and nuclear structural defects and underwent a different type of cell division called neosis, in which intracellular cytokinesis occurs and some mononuclear cells are produced from nuclear budding or asymmetric cell division (<a href=\"#bib116\">Sundaram et al., 2004</a>). All these phenotypes pointed to the fact that although <i>ORC1<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells do not survive in culture long term, for the duration that they do grow, they proliferate extremely slowly and are grossly abnormal.

These cells were still susceptible to <i>ORC2</i> knockdown using four sgRNAs selected from our CRISPR screens and also partially rescued the phenotype with two sgRNAs using a CRISPR-sgRNA resistant mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup>.

Based on these observations with ORC2 and the results with <i>ORC1<sup>-/-</sup></i> lines, cells were unable to proliferate for many generations and produced abnormally structured cells, as well as data analyzed by tiling-sgRNA CRISPR screens, we conclude that ORC is essential in human cells.

The <i>ORC1<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells have excess levels of CDC6 protein bound to chromatin (<a href=\"#bib108\">Shibata et al., 2016</a>) and since CDC6 is related to ORC1 and can bind to the other ORC subunits, we suggest that CDC6 might compensate, albeit poorly, for the absence of ORC1 in loading MCM2-7 proteins and establishing pre-RCs. A recent report described human cells that proliferated in the absence of ORC2 or ORC5 (<a href=\"#bib109\">Shibata and Dutta, 2020</a>), but we suggest that a detailed molecular and phenotypic analysis of these cells be examined in greater detail as described in this report.",

However, if the screens use only a handful of guides targeting annotated essential regions, it may still result in data which may or may not score a gene as essential. Tiling-sgRNA CRISPR-Cas9 screens on the other hand test ‘functional’ or ‘essential’ domains in a more rigorous and unbiased way (<a href=\"#bib46\">He et al., 2019</a>). Using this approach, sgRNAs tiled across entire open reading frames of ORC1-6 and CDC6 enabled us to correlate the negative selection phenotype to functional domains within these proteins. The combined results also confirmed that all ORC1-6 and CDC6 proteins were essential in cancer cells as well as a human diploid cell line, including ORC2 that was characterized as non-essential based on multiple shRNA and whole genome CRISPR/Cas9 screens in numerous types of cells in the DepMap portal (<a href=\"https://depmap.org/portal/\">https://depmap.org/portal/</a>). We were able to identify many sgRNAs that targeted <i>ORC2</i> in the tiling-sgRNA CRISPR screen and the two chosen cloned sgRNAs that killed cells were successfully complemented using a <i>mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup></i> transgene, demonstrating specificity of the knockdowns.

It was not surprising that ORC2 is essential for loading MCM2, and hence MCM2-7, to establish pre-RCs and origins of DNA replication across the genome. In the absence of ORC2, cells loaded very little MCM2, most likely resulting in too few origins of replication and a consequently slow S phase and arrest with a near 4C DNA content and ongoing DNA synthesis. ORC2 depletion yielded other phenotypes, including large nuclei and a failure to execute mitosis. The large nuclei, also observed in the <i>ORC1<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells, have large CENP-C and HP1<i>α</i> foci, probably due to decompaction of the centromeric associated α-satellite DNA, as observed previously (<a href=\"#bib99\">Prasanth et al., 2010</a>). We suggest a general role for ORC in nuclear organization and organizing chromatin domains in the nucleus, including heterochromatin. In yeast, ORC is essential for transcriptional silencing at the silent mating type heterochromatic loci <i>HMRa</i> and <i>HMLα</i> loci and its function in replication are separable from that in silencing (<a href=\"#bib13\">Bell et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Palacios DeBeer et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Ehrenhofer-Murray et al., 1995</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i>, ORC localizes and associates with heterochromatin protein HP1 during interphase and mitosis, and heterozygous recessive lethal mutations in <i>DmORC2</i> suppress position effect variegation (<a href=\"#bib57\">Huang et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Pak et al., 1997</a>). In humans, ORC1 interacts with RB and SUV39H1, a histone methyltransferase that tri-methylates histone H3K9 which HP1 binds to repress E2F1-dependent CCNE1 transcription (<a href=\"#bib52\">Hossain and Stillman, 2016</a>). ORC1 and ORC3 (a tight ORC2 binding partner) directly interact with HP1, and depletion of ORC subunits disrupt localization of HP1 and the compaction of chromosome 9 α-satellite repeats DNA (<a href=\"#bib92\">Pak et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Prasanth et al., 2010</a>). Furthermore, ORC1 binds to the histone H3K9me3 and H4K20me2 methylation marks and co-localizes with histone H2A.Z, suggesting ORC may organize higher order chromatin structures via direct interactions with modified histones (<a href=\"#bib52\">Hossain and Stillman, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Kuo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Long et al., 2019</a>).

We had observed abnormal mitotic cells following long-term (72 hr) treatment of cells with shRNAs that targeted <i>ORC2</i> but it was not clear if this phenotype was due to incomplete DNA replication (<a href=\"#bib98\">Prasanth et al., 2004</a>). However, in the current study, acute removal of ORC2 captured some cells with a clear defect in chromosome congression during mitosis. Moreover, both ORC2 and ORC3 localize to centromeres (<a href=\"#bib28\">Craig et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Prasanth et al., 2004</a>), suggesting that they play a role in spindle attachment or centromeric DNA organization, particularly the centromere associated satellite repeat sequences. We speculate that in ancestral species, ORC localized at origins of DNA replication and this ORC also functioned in organization of chromosomes and in chromosome segregation, but upon separation of DNA replication and chromosome segregation with the advent of mitosis, separate functions of ORC in DNA replication, chromatin, or nuclear organization and chromosome segregation were retained, but executed at different times during the cell division cycle.",

This profile is then corrected to remove GC content effects by normalizing counts based on LOWESS smoothing of count vs. GC content data in each bin. Final copy number profiles are normalized so that the autosome has an average copy number of 2. Plots were generated with G-Graph MUMdex software - MUMdex Genome Alignment Anal. Softw.

However, some adaption may have occurred in ORC 1 null cell lines at some time prior to or at the time of mutation. This null ORC1 line does replicate for roughly 30 generations and contrasts starkly to what happens with the ORC2 nulls. Why? No real discussion is presented and it may it be that Shibata was on to something for cancer cells? The reviewing editor wonders if a repair dependent process for an ORC1 null line may let cells with subsequent defective DNA mutations arise, with the mutations then ultimately leading to cell death or senescence? Investigating the loading of the MCMs may help clarify these questions.",

The reference to Asano and Park (PNAS 2008; reviewer #3) does set a precedent for the point that certain types of DNA replication may occur in special cell types with \"undetectable\" levels of ORC1; e.g., polytene cell replication occurring in salivary glands (although in a subsequent paper certain ORC1 mutations were reported as female sterile and defects were found in follicle cell amplification). However, in tissue with very low levels of ORC 1 from maternal stores, not detectable by protein blot, some MCM loading may still occur, especially in heterogeneous tissue where the majority of protein comes from post replicating cells. We feel the cell-type specific points with these established human cell lines are essential for publication, given the major implications for cancer, which are still controversial even given that ORC 1 null mutations are lethal for both <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> and mice.",

If not, they should implement their FACS/Edu experiment to assess this; the FACS/Mcm loading assay might also prove informative.

This approach, which included an inducible degron and select resistance to sgRNAs, was well-designed and meticulously executed. However, it is not clear whether Orc2 protein is completely lost in these cells. They state that \"no truncated form of protein was detected\". However, their western blot in Figure 3A shows a band migrating slightly faster than the endogenous Orc2 and, given the deletion size of approximately 50 amino acids (or 5 kDa), this species seems to be approximately the correct size of a C-terminal truncated protein. The authors only state that this is a \"nonspecific smaller band\" but do not provide any data to support this conclusion. Do the authors have additional evidence to add? If not, the authors should use their Orc3 IP experiment (Figure 8—figure supplement 1), for which they have all reagents in hand and which was used to verify that the Shibata Orc2<sup>-/-</sup> is not a true knockout, to confirm in their Orc2_H-2, H-4 and H-5 lines that the faster migrating band is, in fact, a non-specific protein that does not pull down with Orc3 (with positive controls run simultaneously).",

This has been a controversial area as some authors (notably Shibata et al) have suggested that ORC1 and ORC2 are not essential, while others (notably McKinley and Cheeseman) have suggested that they are essential. In this manuscript the authors use a combination of high density CRISPR mutagenesis and cell lines that allow rapid depletion to come to the conclusion that all of the ORC subunits and Cdc6 are essential. In addition, the authors perform extensive analysis of strains that allow rapid ORC2 depletion, observing defects in DNA replication, chromosome condensation, and mitosis. Finally, they analyze the previously described cell lines that grow in the absence of ORC1 or ORC2 to address how they are still able to grow.",

For each gene they created a series of guide RNAs that spanned the full coding region of each gene and then asked how cells treated with the guide RNA grew relative to control untreated cells. By comparison of the growth differences observed to control guide RNAs that, the authors conclude that all six ORC genes and Cdc6 are essential. What is less clear is whether the authors can conclude that the site of targeting reveals the importance of that region. Although the authors state that targeting sites of conserved regions have more impact than non-conserved regions, there are many instances when this correlation is not observed. In addition, when there are strong effects in non-conserved regions (e.g. the IDRs of ORC1 and ORC2) the authors conclude that they are essential regions of the protein. It is not clear that the differing effects could just as likely be due to the frequency of making deletions and frame shifts at different regions rather than their conservation(for example, if the local DNA sequences have micro-homologies that lend themselves to deletions). If the authors want to make such conclusions they need to provide a more quantitative analysis than what is shown in the current manuscript (e.g. show a correlation between the LFC and the extent of conservation of the targeted region – i.e. the 20 aa on either side of the CRISPR cut site).",

They show that removal of ORC2 leads to rapid loss of proliferation and cell cycle arrest. Using markers for the DNA damage checkpoint they also show that this checkpoint is activated in these cells. They further find that depletion of ORC2 results in aberrant nuclear morphology and decondensation of centromeric heterochromatin. Not surprisingly, they also see defects in replication initiation. This is not particularly well demonstrated by the data in Figure 5 as all the defects observed could be due to difficulty in elongation. However, the data in Figure 6 addressing MCM2 association with chromatin are more compelling and are certainly in line with the known functions of ORC. Finally, the authors observe ORC2 depletion also results in defects in centromeric condensation, nuclear morphology, and entry into and completion of mitosis.",

For the ORC2<sup>-/-</sup> line, the conclusion is simple. It is clear that there is still functional ORC2 present. In the case of the ORC1<sup>-/-</sup> cell line, this does not seem to be the case. Instead, the authors focus on the ORC1<sup>-/-</sup> cell line characteristics. They observe that it has limited proliferation capacity of 30 generations or less and that it has significant morphological and cell division defects. Nevertheless, the data seems to show that ORC1 is not required for successful cell division and DNA replication (similar to what was reported by Shibata et al.). The authors should do a better job of saying that they agree with the previous studies and discuss more about how this could be the case instead of only focusing on the ORC2<sup>-/-</sup> strain not being a deletion. For example, there are other studies in <i>Drosophila</i> also observing ORC1 as being non-essential for DNA replication (Park, S.Y., and Asano, M. (2008). The origin recognition complex is dispensable for endoreplication in <i>Drosophila</i>. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 105, 12343-12348.). Certainly, it is true that these cells are unhappy and at a severe competitive advantage, but they are replicating their DNA and proliferating in the absence of ORC1 and this observation remains unexpected and worthy of discussion by the authors.",

This alternative possibility should be discussed more directly by the authors as there is nothing in the paper to suggest that the effects are direct (e.g. experiments removing ORC function in G1 or M phase arrested cells).",

However, some adaption may have occurred in ORC 1 null cell lines at some time prior to or at the time of mutation. This null ORC1 line does replicate for roughly 30 generations and contrasts starkly to what happens with the ORC2 nulls. Why? No real discussion is presented and it may it be that Shibata was on to something for cancer cells?

The reference to Asano and Park (PNAS 2008; reviewer #3) does set a precedent for the point that certain types of DNA replication may occur in special cell types with \"undetectable\" levels of ORC1 ; e.g., polytene cell replication occurring in salivary glands (although in a subsequent paper certain ORC1 mutations were reported as female sterile and defects were found in follicle cell amplification). However, in tissue with very low levels of ORC 1 from maternal stores, not detectable by protein blot, some MCM loading may still occur, especially in heterogeneous tissue where the majority of protein comes from post replicating cells. We feel the cell-type specific points with these established human cell lines are essential for publication, given the major implications for cancer, which are still controversial even given that ORC 1 null mutations are lethal for both <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> and mice.",

While the authors clearly show that Orc2 is essential, their data regarding Orc1 is more ambiguous. Indeed, they observe, consistent with Shibata et al., that the Orc1 null line is a true knockout and yet this cell line is still capable of proliferation. This indicates that some level of DNA replication is occurring, as incomplete replication would quickly halt proliferation (as indicated by their ORC2 knockout line which stops proliferating after a single round of division). Do the authors have an idea of what level of replication is occurring in the Orc1 null cells? If not, they should implement their FACS/Edu experiment to assess this; the FACS/Mcm loading assay might also prove informative. And if replication/Mcm loading is occurring, do the authors agree with the Shibata conclusion, that Orc1 is not absolutely essential for replication in human cancer cells, at least for the short term (fewer than 30 generations)? How might cancer cells cope with this from a mechanistic standpoint? The authors should expand their Discussion to include these points.",

However, it is not clear whether Orc2 protein is completely lost in these cells. They state that \"no truncated form of protein was detected\".

In this manuscript the authors use a combination of high density CRISPR mutagenesis and cell lines that allow rapid depletion to come to the conclusion that all of the ORC subunits and Cdc6 are essential. In addition, the authors perform extensive analysis of strains that allow rapid ORC2 depletion, observing defects in DNA replication, chromosome condensation, and mitosis.

For each gene they created a series of guide RNAs that spanned the full coding region of each gene and then asked how cells treated with the guide RNA grew relative to control untreated cells. By comparison of the growth differences observed to control guide RNAs that, the authors conclude that all six ORC genes and Cdc6 are essential. What is less clear is whether the authors can conclude that the site of targeting reveals the importance of that region. Although the authors state that targeting sites of conserved regions have more impact than non-conserved regions, there are many instances when this correlation is not observed. In addition, when there are strong effects in non-conserved regions (e.g. the IDRs of ORC1 and ORC2) the authors conclude that they are essential regions of the protein. It is not clear that the differing effects could just as likely be due to the frequency of making deletions and frame shifts at different regions rather than their conservation(for example, if the local DNA sequences have micro-homologies that lend themselves to deletions). If the authors want to make such conclusions they need to provide a more quantitative analysis than what is shown in the current manuscript (e.g. show a correlation between the LFC and the extent of conservation of the targeted region – i.e. the 20 aa on either side of the CRISPR cut site).",

They further find that depletion of ORC2 results in aberrant nuclear morphology and decondensation of centromeric heterochromatin. Not surprisingly, they also see defects in replication initiation. This is not particularly well demonstrated by the data in Figure 5 as all the defects observed could be due to difficulty in elongation. However, the data in Figure 6 addressing MCM2 association with chromatin are more compelling and are certainly in line with the known functions of ORC.

Instead, the authors focus on the ORC1<sup>-/-</sup> cell line characteristics. They observe that it has limited proliferation capacity of 30 generations or less and that it has significant morphological and cell division defects. Nevertheless, the data seems to show that ORC1 is not required for successful cell division and DNA replication (similar to what was reported by Shibata et al.). The authors should do a better job of saying that they agree with the previous studies and discuss more about how this could be the case instead of only focusing on the ORC2<sup>-/-</sup> strain not being a deletion. For example, there are other studies in <i>Drosophila</i> also observing ORC1 as being non-essential for DNA replication (Park, S.Y., and Asano, M. (2008). The origin recognition complex is dispensable for endoreplication in <i>Drosophila</i>. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 105, 12343-12348.).

This alternative possibility should be discussed more directly by the authors as there is nothing in the paper to suggest that the effects are direct (e.g. experiments removing ORC function in G1 or M phase arrested cells).",

ORC2 localizes at the kinetochore during M phase, and we suggest that those mitotic cells lacking ORC2 cannot properly align and segregate sister chromatids during M phase. This could be due to direct outcome of ORC2 removal or that ORC2 is essential for recruiting other factors before M phase. In Figure 5 we’ve shown that cells can progress normally during first cell cycle upon release from double thymidine block, which indicates loss of ORC2 during mitosis doesn’t affect cell division. Nonetheless, ORC2 could still be part of an essential components for recruiting or loading important factors for chromosome congression, and this action can be traced back to G1 or S phase, which will then be hard to discriminate from its replication function.",
