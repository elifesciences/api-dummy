The tool can correct for small movements in images collected by a technique called fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). As a result, clear images can be captured in situations that were not previously possible. For example, Warren et al. watched cancer cells migrating to the liver of a mouse from the spleen over 24 hours, and, using a fluorescent biosensor, showed that a repurposed drug interferes with how well the cells can attach to the liver. In addition, Warren et al. used the software to take steady 3D images of human skin in a volunteerâ€™s arm, which could be used to study drug penetration."

This species is characterized by body mass and stature similar to small-bodied human populations but a small endocranial volume similar to australopiths. Cranial morphology of <i>H. naledi</i> is unique, but most similar to early <i>Homo</i> species including <i>Homo erectus</i>, <i>Homo habilis</i> or <i>Homo rudolfensis</i>. While primitive, the dentition is generally small and simple in occlusal morphology. <i>H. naledi</i> has humanlike manipulatory adaptations of the hand and wrist. It also exhibits a humanlike foot and lower limb. These humanlike aspects are contrasted in the postcrania with a more primitive or australopith-like trunk, shoulder, pelvis and proximal femur. Representing at least 15 individuals with most skeletal elements repeated multiple times, this is the largest assemblage of a single species of hominins yet discovered in Africa."

						"text": "Intravital microscopy can provide unique insights into the function of biological processes in a native context. However, physiological motion caused by peristalsis, respiration and the heartbeat can present a significant challenge, particularly for functional readouts such as fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), which require longer acquisition times to obtain a quantitative readout. Here, we present and benchmark <i>Galene</i>, a versatile multi-platform software tool for image-based correction of sample motion blurring in both time resolved and conventional laser scanning fluorescence microscopy data in two and three dimensions. We show that <i>Galene</i> is able to resolve intravital FLIM-FRET images of intra-abdominal organs in murine models and NADH autofluorescence of human dermal tissue imaging subject to a wide range of physiological motions. Thus, <i>Galene</i> can enable FLIM imaging in situations where a stable imaging platform is not always possible and rescue previously discarded quantitative imaging data.",
