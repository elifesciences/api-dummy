After consulting with Digirati, and an exploration by its team into using Docker with the existing infrastructure, it was obvious this was a good step forward.

New elements can also be added through extensions, so definitions that some people use can still be shared, yet they don’t have to be enforced on those that don’t use them (plain-language summaries or IIIF images, for example).

The discussion at the <a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/7ccd9e42/in-technology-a-summary-of-the-libero-community-sprint\">Libero Sprint</a> in August 2018 was the genesis for governance ideas. Having early consensus on how the project should be governed was important – it increased engagement from contributors because they had a clear understanding of how they could use and contribute to Libero.<br /><br />We discussed licensing and the ability to use the platform for commercial gain, both now and in the future, and how to ensure that the platform always remains as free, open-source software. To ease administration and decision making in the community we discussed the possibility of assigning ownership to a single organisation. We explored the involvement of a foundation for this, either a new one or an existing one such as the Apache Foundation or the Apereo Foundation, but decided that eLife was well placed to act as project lead. With further exploration of existing open-source governance models we decided that something based on a ’benevolent dictatorship’ model would suit the community, because eLife was able to commit the time and people whereas other contributors could not make as large or as full-time a commitment, but were keen for development to progress unimpeded.<br /><br />To ensure that others have a way to influence eLife (as project lead) we decided to support the model with the formation of a <a href=\"https://libero.pub/governance/steering-committee.html\">steering committee</a> for core contributors/organisations who are transparent about their involvement through the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with us. We continued our discussion into the realms of code ownership and copyright too, eventually proposing and investigating the use of a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Exploring a robust CLA was also a suggestion from our conversation with Scott Wilson: he reminded us that they can be used to ensure the license is kept open and to give contributors the right to attribution. Our CLA is derived from the Fiduciary License Agreement created by the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) and, with help from their team, we created the Libero CLA for both individuals and entities. Our CLAs, like those from the FSFE, are available for re-use under a CC-BY-SA license at <a href=\"https://libero.pub/governance/cla/\">https://libero.pub/governance/cla/</a> or <a href=\"http://contributoragreements.org\">http://contributoragreements.org</a>.",

Xerte provides tools for e-learning authors and started in Julian’s department at the university. Once it had gathered users and grown beyond the university Julian thought it would be useful to have a foundation administer the project. He worked with the Apereo Foundation and had to add some new elements to their project community before it was suitable for adoption by the foundation. His insight and tips on how to structure various aspects of the community, and his feedback on our ideas, were extremely valuable and gave us confidence that we still had this as a future option for Libero. Taking ideas from the structure of projects at foundations like Apereo has been useful in ensuring the Libero community is prepared for the growth and expansion that we would like to see.<br /><br />All the conversations around governance were really focused and clear, which resulted in a governance document at <a href=\"https://libero.pub/governance/\">https://libero.pub/governance/</a> that describes our approach in detail.",
