Another example is a recent paper in Nature by Li et al. on robustness to perturbation in neural circuits, which used Binder to share simulation results from a computational model. Notebooks demonstrating the discovery of gravitational waves from the LIGO group were turned into a Binder, which has been by far our most popular example."
